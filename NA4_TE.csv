Mayo Clinic,Academic,W1,W1,"Tennis elbow (lateral epicondylitis) is a painful condition that occurs when tendons in your elbow are overloaded, usually by repetitive motions of the wrist and arm.

Despite its name, athletes aren't the only people who develop tennis elbow. People whose jobs feature the types of motions that can lead to tennis elbow include plumbers, painters, carpenters and butchers.

The pain of tennis elbow occurs primarily where the tendons of your forearm muscles attach to a bony bump on the outside of your elbow. Pain can also spread into your forearm and wrist.

Rest and over-the-counter pain relievers often help relieve tennis elbow. If conservative treatments don't help or if symptoms are disabling, your doctor might suggest surgery.

Tennis elbow is an overuse and muscle strain injury. The cause is repeated contraction of the forearm muscles that you use to straighten and raise your hand and wrist. The repeated motions and stress to the tissue may result in a series of tiny tears in the tendons that attach the forearm muscles to the bony prominence at the outside of your elbow.

As the name suggests, playing tennis — especially repeated use of the backhand stroke with poor technique — is one possible cause of tennis elbow. However, many other common arm motions can cause tennis elbow, including:

Using plumbing tools.
Painting.
Driving screws.
Cutting up cooking ingredients, particularly meat.
Repetitive computer mouse use.
Risk factors.
Factors that may increase your risk of tennis elbow include:

Age. While tennis elbow affects people of all ages, it's most common in adults between the ages of 30 and 50.
Occupation. People who have jobs that involve repetitive motions of the wrist and arm are more likely to develop tennis elbow. Examples include plumbers, painters, carpenters, butchers and cooks.
Certain sports. Participating in racket sports increases your risk of tennis elbow, especially if you employ poor stroke technique.",53.9,10.1,9,12,7.4,9
Johns Hopkins,Academic,W2,W2,"Lateral epicondylitis, commonly known as tennis elbow, is swelling of the tendons that bend your wrist backward away from your palm.

A tendon is a tough cord of tissue that connects muscles to bones. The tendon most likely involved in tennis elbow is called the extensor carpi radialis brevis. Tennis elbow is usually diagnosed in both men and women between the ages of 30 and 50 years.Tennis elbow, as the name implies, is often caused by the force of the tennis racket hitting balls in the backhand position. Your forearm muscles, which attach to the outside of your elbow, may become sore from excessive strain. When making a backhand stroke in tennis, the tendons that roll over the end of our elbow can become damaged. Tennis elbow may be caused by: Improper backhand stroke. Weak shoulder and wrist muscles. Using a tennis racket that is too tightly strung or too short. Other racquet sports, like racquetball or squash. Hitting the ball off center on the racket, or hitting heavy, wet balls. However, many people who suffer from tennis elbow do not play tennis. The problem can be caused by any repetitive movement. Other causes of tennis elbow include: Painting with a brush or roller. Operating a chain saw. Frequent use of other hand tools on a regular basis.

Cleveland Clinic,Academic,W3,W3,"Tennis elbow is an overuse injury that occurs when tendons (tissues that attach muscles to bones) become overloaded, leading to inflammation, degeneration and potential tearing. It commonly affects tennis players who grip their racquets too tightly. But anyone can develop this painful condition, medically known as lateral epicondylitis. 

Repetitive arm movements can cause your forearm muscles to get fatigued. A single tendon attaches this muscle to the bony bump on the outside of your elbow (lateral epicondyle). As your muscle gets tired, the tendon takes more of the load. This overloading can cause inflammation and pain, known as tendinitis. Over time, this overloading can cause a degenerative condition known as tendinosis. Together tendinitis and tendinosis can then lead to tendon tearing.

Sometimes, a sudden arm or elbow injury causes tennis elbow. Rarely, people develop the condition for no known reason (idiopathic tennis elbow).",35.7,13.9,11.5,14,9.8,11
WebMD,Private,W4,W4,"Tennis elbow is a type of tendinitis -- swelling of the tendons -- that causes pain in the elbow and arm. These tendons are bands of tough tissue that connect the muscles of your lower arm to the bone. Despite its name, you can still get tennis elbow even if you've never been near a tennis court. Instead, any repetitive gripping activities, especially if they use the thumb and first two fingers, may contribute to tennis elbow. Tennis elbow is the most common reason that people see their doctors for elbow pain. It can pop up in people of any age, but it's most common at about age 40.

Tennis elbow usually develops over time. Repetitive motions -- like gripping a racket during a swing -- can strain the muscles and put too much stress on the tendons. That constant tugging can eventually cause microscopic tears in the tissue.

AAOS,Academic,W5,W5,"Tennis elbow, or lateral epicondylitis, is a painful condition of the elbow caused by overuse. Not surprisingly, playing tennis or other racquet sports can cause this condition. However, several other sports and activities besides sports can also put you at risk.

Tennis elbow is inflammation or, in some cases, microtearing of the tendons that join the forearm muscles on the outside of the elbow. The forearm muscles and tendons become damaged from overuse — repeating the same motions again and again. This leads to pain and tenderness on the outside of the elbow.

There are many treatment options for tennis elbow. In most cases, treatment involves a team approach. Primary doctors, physical therapists and, in some cases, surgeons work together to provide the most effective care.

Overuse
Recent studies show that tennis elbow is often due to damage to a specific forearm muscle. The ECRB muscle helps stabilize the wrist when the elbow is straight. This occurs during a tennis groundstroke, for example. When the ECRB is weakened from overuse, microscopic tears form in the tendon where it attaches to the lateral epicondyle. This leads to inflammation and pain.

The ECRB may also be at increased risk for damage because of its position. As the elbow bends and straightens, the muscle rubs against bony bumps. This can cause gradual wear and tear of the muscle over time.

Activities
Athletes are not the only people who get tennis elbow. Many people with tennis elbow participate in work or recreational activities that require repetitive and vigorous use of the forearm muscle or repetitive extension of the wrist and hand.

Painters, plumbers, and carpenters are particularly prone to developing tennis elbow. Studies have shown that auto workers, cooks, and even butchers get tennis elbow more often than the rest of the population. It is thought that the repetition and weight lifting required in these occupations leads to injury.

Age
Most people who get tennis elbow are between the ages of 30 and 50, although anyone can get tennis elbow if they have the risk factors. In racquet sports like tennis, improper stroke technique and improper equipment may be risk factors.

Lateral epicondylitis can occur without any recognized repetitive injury. This occurence is called idiopathic, or of an unknown cause.",51.9,11.7,9.6,12,8.7,10
Medical News Today,Private,W6,W6,"Tennis elbow is an inflammation of the tendons that join the muscles of the forearm to the outside of the elbow. It often occurs due to overusing the forearm muscles and tendons and those around the elbow joint.

Tennis elbow is also known as lateral elbow pain or lateral epicondylitis and is not necessarily related to tennis. However, tennis players often develop the condition because it stems from repetitive muscle use. Half of all tennis players will get tennis elbow in their career.

Tennis elbow is thought to affect between 1 and 3 percent of the population in the United States (U.S.). It usually occurs between the ages of 30 and 50 years.

The cause of tennis elbow stems from repeating incorrect movements of the arm. This can lead to small tears in the tendon attachment at the elbow. In tennis, this translates to the repeated motion and force of hitting a ball with a racquet.

Incorrect technique can cause the power in the swing of a racquet to rotate through and around the wrist. This creates a movement on the wrist instead of the elbow joint or shoulder. This can increase pressure on the tendon and cause irritation and inflammation.

Most often, the extensor muscles become painful due this tendon breakdown. The extensor muscles are those that straighten the wrist.

Tennis elbow is associated with the extension of the fingers and the wrist. This is the kind of movement that allows the person to “snap” or flick the wrist, such as during a racquet swing.

Despite the name, tennis elbow refers to any injury to this particular tendon caused by overuse. Tennis elbow can stem from daily activities such as:

using scissors.
cutting tough food.
gardening.
sporting activities that involve high amounts of throwing.

Ortho Atlanta,Private,W10,W10,"Repetitive Gripping Activities
This is a broad category of potential causes. Historically it’s included activities and occupations that involve repeated use of a muscle.

Landscaping
The grip-action of hedge clipping, raking, hand-weeding, and even holding a small power tool stable over time can cause elbow tendonitis in Atlanta.

Painting
Full-time painters often complain of pain radiating from the elbow. Their days are full of repetitive wrist and elbow action as they scrape, prime, and re-paint surfaces.

Construction
Hired laborers on a construction site spend hours hammering, using screwdrivers, and handsaws.

Sports
This injury is aptly named, for tennis players make up the majority of athletes who develop elbow injury in Atlanta. Baseball, basketball, and volleyball players can fall victim to tennis elbow or elbow tendonitis, too, if they’re not careful about using the correct form. The injury worsens over time if you continue to use the muscle incorrectly.

Hobbies
Hobbies are meant to be relaxing, but some of the most trending hobbies of the 2010’s can cause more stress than calm:.

Knitting.
Crocheting.
Tatting.
These project-based crafts have recently become a popular pastime. The repetitive motion involved can be a double whammy to your forearm muscles, as you’re simultaneously rotating and flexing. The result can often be an elbow tendonitis condition in Atlanta.

The Workplace
Whatever you do for work, chances are the great majority of it is computer based. Small muscle injuries aren’t exclusive to front-desk secretaries. Pay attention to how much you’re typing in a day and how you move your wrist when manipulating the touch-pad or the hand-driven mouse.

Communication
The primary cause of tennis elbow is defined as, “repetitive gripping activities, especially if they use the thumb and first two fingers.”

For most, the act of holding a smartphone while simultaneously manipulating the screen is routine. It’s also causing you a great deal of potential pain, as you’re asking muscles to work incorrectly all-day long.",49.5,12.2,10.1,12,9.5,10
MSSPC,Private,W11,W11,"Tennis elbow can be caused by repetition motion, especially twisting motion. What people don't know, is that many different activities besides tennis can lead to it. Up to 3% of Americans (around 9.7 million people) suffer from tennis elbow every year. But only around 5% of tennis elbow cases are caused by tennis.

Lateral epicondylitis, a.k.a tennis elbow can caused by repetition motion, especially twisting motion. What people don’t know, is that many different activities besides tennis can lead to it.

Let’s look at some of the often overlooked, non-tennis-related causes of tennis elbow.

1. Typing

The first thing people think of when they hear “typing” and “pain” together is carpal tunnel syndrome. But people that work at computers all day are also at risk for developing tennis elbow.

These daily, often continual wrist and finger movements activate the forearm muscles. Repetitive use can lead to tennis elbow.

One way of avoiding injury is by keeping your wrist in as close to a neutral position as possible.

Bending the wrist is often where injury comes into play. Purchasing an ergonomic keyboard and mouse could also be worthwhile. Our wrists are often kept in unnatural positions for hours on end, while doing computer work. Ergonomic equipment can help with easing this strain.

2. Painting

Whether you paint for a living or do it as a hobby on the weekends, you’re at risk for tennis elbow.

Using a paint brush and roller involves repetitive strain. There’s also a lot of twisting and bending involved in painting. Those two ingredients are a recipe for tennis elbow.

Make sure that you stretch your wrists and arms before painting to warm them up. Take breaks throughout the day. These should lessen your risk.

3. Automotive work

Wrench. Ratchet. Torque. These all happen while you’re working on cars. And they all sound painful.

Let’s look at the causes of tennis elbow again. Repetitive? Yes. Twisting and bending? Check. Auto mechanics can be at risk for tennis elbow. If you work on cars for a living, you may be at higher risk than a hobbyist.

In this case, using the right tools can keep pain away. Power tools are easier on your arm than hand tools, though using any tool repeatedly may also lead to tennis elbow.  Along with stretching before work, using different tools may lessen a mechanic’s risk.

4. Carpentry

Sawing back and hammering over and over may put carpenters at risk for tennis elbow. Carpenters may have to keep their hands and wrists in strained positions for long period of time.

Here again, tools can make a difference. But also pay attention to your technique. When your job involves repetitive motion, try to make smooth controlled movements. Being herky-jerky with your arms may increase your risk for tennis elbow.

5. Weightlifting

Repetition. It’s in the very nature of weightlifting. Exercises like curls, done with heavy weights, can lead to tennis elbow.

Some exercises can cause more pain than others. If you’re suffering from tennis elbow in the weight room, consider the following advice from Livestrong:

Take a break from lifting
Do less dumbbell exercises
Focus on lower weights and higher reps
6. Golf
If you’re a golfer, you’ve probably heard of golfer’s elbow. But according to Golf Fitness Magazine, most golfers suffer more from tennis elbow than golfer’s elbow.

The golf swing involves a lot of force on the wrists. And that strain is very repetitive. That’s why golfers, especially older golfers, run into tendon problems.

If you’re a golfer suffering from tennis or golfer’s elbow, start with rest. Try anti-inflammatory medication, and make sure that you’re getting warmed up before playing.

7. Baseball
Baseball is a sport well-known for the stress it puts on arms. That’s especially true for pitchers. While you might hear about “Tommy John surgery,” in the news, many pitchers suffer from tennis elbow.

Pitchers put tremendous strain on their arm when they throw a baseball.

If you’re a baseball player, you can avoid tennis elbow by stretching your arm before throwing. Don’t overuse your arm by throwing too much.",66.7,8.1,6.4,10,6.4,7

Improper equipment in sports like tennis.",43.2,14.4,10.9,11,10.3,10
Orthopedic Institute of Pennsylvania,Private,W17,W17,"Tennis elbow, also known as lateral epicondylitis, is a common overuse injury resulting from repetitive motion involving the tendons in your elbow. These tendons, the extensor carpi radialis brevis and extensor digitorum communis of the forearm, extend and stabilize the wrist as they anchor your muscles to your bones. When the attachment site weakens, you start to experience pain and tenderness while engaged in everyday activities involving gripping, grasping or lifting.

The first documented reference to tennis elbow was published in 1883, noting that frequent tennis players presented with pain in and around the elbow area of their racquet arm. Subsequent studies observed that using inappropriately matched equipment for one’s body size and muscle strength, gripping the racket too hard, hitting the ball off center and using poor technique on ground strokes increased the likelihood of tennis elbow pain.

Tennis elbow is most common in people ages 30 to 50, although the condition can be seen in people of all ages. Depending upon their activity level, children and senior citizens can be diagnosed with tennis elbow as well. There is no gender-related component to tennis elbow, and men and women are equally likely to be diagnosed with the condition.

Overuse is the most common cause of tennis elbow pain. When you frequently engage in activities that place stress on the tendon attachments and the muscle-tendon unit, microscopic tears form in the tendon where it is attached to the bone. These tears lead to the inflammation and pain associated with tennis elbow. Typically, overuse is defined as a high activity level three or more times per week with activity lasting 30 minutes or more per session. A poor overall fitness level can exacerbate the problems caused by overuse of the forearm and elbow area.

Tennis elbow pain can sometimes be linked to specific injuries or traumas. If you suffer a direct blow to the elbow, this could result in the swelling of the tendon and subsequent degeneration. When seeking treatment for your condition, it is important to inform your doctor of any injury or trauma that could be linked to the development of tennis elbow.

Finally, as with many medical conditions, genetics play a role in the development of tennis elbow. Some people are born with tendons that are naturally less durable, which makes them prone to developing the condition at an earlier age or in conjunction with pain in the shoulders and feet.",42.4,16,12.9,11,11.5,13

The elbow joint is made up of the bone in the upper arm (the humerus) and one of the bones in the lower arm (ulna). The bony prominences, or bumps, at the bottom of the humerus are called the epicondyles. The bump on the outer side of the elbow is called the lateral epicondyle.

Lateral epicondylitis is a condition that causes pain and tenderness at the prominence on the outer part of the elbow. The condition occurs as a result of overusing the forearm muscles that straighten and raise the hand and wrist. When tendinopathy, or fiber microtearing, occurs at the muscle origins at their point of attachment, the lateral epicondyle. Small tears in the tendon tissue can occur, and the muscles may strain and irritate their attachment at the bone. These muscles act to extend the wrist and allow lifting.

Causes
Despite the common name for lateral epicondylitis, tennis elbow, the condition can be caused by other activities besides playing racquet sports. Many commonplace activities can strain the tendons. Basically, any activity that twists and extends the wrist can lead to lateral epicondylitis. Rarely, a direct blow to the outside of the elbow can also lead to the condition.",52,12.9,10.1,10,9.4,10

Tennis elbow is the common term for a painful elbow disorder.

The technical name for tennis elbow is ""lateral epicondylitis"". This term refers to an inflammation that is occurring near a small point or projection of the upper arm bone (humerus) just above the elbow joint on the outer side of the arm. However, pain can also occur in the forearm and wrist.

The pain from tennis elbow comes mainly from injured or damaged tendons near the elbow. Tendons are strong bands of tissue that connect muscles to bones. When repeatedly stressed or overused, tendons can become inflamed and degenerate. This results in a painful condition called tendinopathy, the medical term for disorder of a tendon. Tennis elbow is simply a specific type of tendinopathy that occurs in a particular part of the elbow.

Damaged tendons can occur on either side of the elbow. When it happens on the outside of the elbow, which is most common, it is called tennis elbow. When it happens on the inside, it is called ""medial epicondylitis"" or ""golfer's elbow.""

The development of tennis elbow is associated with repeated contraction of the forearm muscles. These muscles control hand and wrist movements. They are attached to tendons that connect them to only two small points of bone just above the elbow, one on the outer side, the other on the inner side.

Muscles connected to the outer side of the elbow (extensors) are responsible for:

straightening the fingers,
bending the wrist upwards, and
rolling the forearm into a palms-up position.
Muscles connected to the inner side of the elbow (flexors) are responsible for:

bending the fingers,
bending the wrist downwards, and
rolling the forearm into a palms-down position.
There are weak points in the way tendons connect these muscles to the bone above the elbow. The points where the tendons attach are sometimes too small to handle the strong force of the powerful muscles. These tendons can get overloaded when the hand and forearm are used in strong, jerky movements such as gripping, lifting, or throwing.

Tendons do not stretch when pulled. They are rope-like structures made of strong, smooth, shiny fibres. Strong forces or sudden impacts, however, can eventually tear their fibers apart in much the same way a rope becomes frayed. This type of injury is called a strain, and usually results in formation of scar tissue. Over time, strained tendons become thickened, bumpy, and irregular. Without rest and time for the tissue to heal, strained tendons can become permanently weakened.",58.8,10.5,9.1,11,7.7,9
