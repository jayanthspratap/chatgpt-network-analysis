NHS (A),Academic,W1,"Tennis elbow is mostly caused by overusing your forearm due to a repetitive or strenuous activity.

It can also sometimes occur after banging or knocking your elbow.

If the muscles in your forearm are strained, tiny tears and inflammation can develop near the bony lump (lateral epicondyle) on the outside of your elbow.

You may get tennis elbow if your forearm muscles are not used to doing a certain activity, such as gardening or decorating. However, even if you use your forearm muscles frequently, it can still happen.

Activities that can cause tennis elbow
You can develop tennis elbow by doing any form of activity that involves repeatedly twisting your wrist and bending your elbow or using your forearm muscles. Examples include:

playing racquet sports (tennis, badminton or squash) or sports that involve throwing (javelin or discus)
using hand tools repeatedly (gardening shears, screwdriver or scissors)
using tools while decorating, plumbing or bricklaying
activities that involve fine, repetitive hand and wrist movements (typing or sewing)
activities that involve repeatedly bending the elbow (playing the violin)
Playing racquet sports increases your risk of developing tennis elbow, particularly if you play for the first time in a long time. However, despite its name, only 5 out of 100 people actually get tennis elbow from playing racquet sports.",,,
Mayo Clinic (A),Academic,W2,"Tennis elbow (lateral epicondylitis) is a painful condition that occurs when tendons in your elbow are overloaded, usually by repetitive motions of the wrist and arm.

Despite its name, athletes aren't the only people who develop tennis elbow. People whose jobs feature the types of motions that can lead to tennis elbow include plumbers, painters, carpenters and butchers.

The pain of tennis elbow occurs primarily where the tendons of your forearm muscles attach to a bony bump on the outside of your elbow. Pain can also spread into your forearm and wrist.

Rest and over-the-counter pain relievers often help relieve tennis elbow. If conservative treatments don't help or if symptoms are disabling, your doctor might suggest surgery.

Tennis elbow is an overuse and muscle strain injury. The cause is repeated contraction of the forearm muscles that you use to straighten and raise your hand and wrist. The repeated motions and stress to the tissue may result in a series of tiny tears in the tendons that attach the forearm muscles to the bony prominence at the outside of your elbow.

As the name suggests, playing tennis — especially repeated use of the backhand stroke with poor technique — is one possible cause of tennis elbow. However, many other common arm motions can cause tennis elbow, including:

Using plumbing tools
Painting
Driving screws
Cutting up cooking ingredients, particularly meat
Repetitive computer mouse use
Risk factors
Factors that may increase your risk of tennis elbow include:

Age. While tennis elbow affects people of all ages, it's most common in adults between the ages of 30 and 50.
Occupation. People who have jobs that involve repetitive motions of the wrist and arm are more likely to develop tennis elbow. Examples include plumbers, painters, carpenters, butchers and cooks.

Cleveland Clinic (A),Academic,W4,"Tennis elbow is an overuse injury that occurs when tendons (tissues that attach muscles to bones) become overloaded, leading to inflammation, degeneration and potential tearing. It commonly affects tennis players who grip their racquets too tightly. But anyone can develop this painful condition, medically known as lateral epicondylitis. 

Repetitive arm movements can cause your forearm muscles to get fatigued. A single tendon attaches this muscle to the bony bump on the outside of your elbow (lateral epicondyle). As your muscle gets tired, the tendon takes more of the load. This overloading can cause inflammation and pain, known as tendinitis. Over time, this overloading can cause a degenerative condition known as tendinosis. Together tendinitis and tendinosis can then lead to tendon tearing.

Sometimes, a sudden arm or elbow injury causes tennis elbow. Rarely, people develop the condition for no known reason (idiopathic tennis elbow).",,,
WebMD (P),Private,W5,"Tennis elbow is a type of tendinitis -- swelling of the tendons -- that causes pain in the elbow and arm. These tendons are bands of tough tissue that connect the muscles of your lower arm to the bone. Despite its name, you can still get tennis elbow even if you've never been near a tennis court. Instead, any repetitive gripping activities, especially if they use the thumb and first two fingers, may contribute to tennis elbow. Tennis elbow is the most common reason that people see their doctors for elbow pain. It can pop up in people of any age, but it's most common at about age 40.

Tennis elbow usually develops over time. Repetitive motions -- like gripping a racket during a swing -- can strain the muscles and put too much stress on the tendons. That constant tugging can eventually cause microscopic tears in the tissue.

AAOS (A),Academic,W6,"Tennis elbow, or lateral epicondylitis, is a painful condition of the elbow caused by overuse. Not surprisingly, playing tennis or other racquet sports can cause this condition. However, several other sports and activities besides sports can also put you at risk.

Tennis elbow is inflammation or, in some cases, microtearing of the tendons that join the forearm muscles on the outside of the elbow. The forearm muscles and tendons become damaged from overuse — repeating the same motions again and again. This leads to pain and tenderness on the outside of the elbow.

There are many treatment options for tennis elbow. In most cases, treatment involves a team approach. Primary doctors, physical therapists and, in some cases, surgeons work together to provide the most effective care.

Overuse
Recent studies show that tennis elbow is often due to damage to a specific forearm muscle. The ECRB muscle helps stabilize the wrist when the elbow is straight. This occurs during a tennis groundstroke, for example. When the ECRB is weakened from overuse, microscopic tears form in the tendon where it attaches to the lateral epicondyle. This leads to inflammation and pain.

The ECRB may also be at increased risk for damage because of its position. As the elbow bends and straightens, the muscle rubs against bony bumps. This can cause gradual wear and tear of the muscle over time.

Activities
Athletes are not the only people who get tennis elbow. Many people with tennis elbow participate in work or recreational activities that require repetitive and vigorous use of the forearm muscle or repetitive extension of the wrist and hand.

Painters, plumbers, and carpenters are particularly prone to developing tennis elbow. Studies have shown that auto workers, cooks, and even butchers get tennis elbow more often than the rest of the population. It is thought that the repetition and weight lifting required in these occupations leads to injury.

Tennis elbow is thought to affect between 1 and 3 percentTrusted Source of the population in the United States (U.S.). It usually occurs between the ages of 30 and 50 yearsTrusted Source.

The cause of tennis elbow stems from repeating incorrect movements of the arm. This can lead to small tears in the tendon attachment at the elbow. In tennis, this translates to the repeated motion and force of hitting a ball with a racquet.

Incorrect technique can cause the power in the swing of a racquet to rotate through and around the wrist. This creates a movement on the wrist instead of the elbow joint or shoulder. This can increase pressure on the tendon and cause irritation and inflammation.

Most often, the extensor muscles become painful due this tendon breakdown. The extensor muscles are those that straighten the wrist.

Tennis elbow is associated with the extension of the fingers and the wrist. This is the kind of movement that allows the person to “snap” or flick the wrist, such as during a racquet swing.

Despite the name, tennis elbow refers to any injury to this particular tendon caused by overuse. Tennis elbow can stem from daily activities such as:

The pain is located on the outside (lateral side) of the elbow, but may radiate down the back of your forearm. You’ll likely feel the pain when you straighten or fully extend your arm.

The tendon is the part of a muscle that attaches to the bone. Forearm tendons attach the forearm muscles to the outer bone of the elbow. Tennis elbow often occurs when a specific muscle in the forearm — the extensor carpi radialis brevis (ECRB) muscle — is damaged. The ECRB helps raise (extend) the wrist.

Repetitive stress weakens the ECRB muscle, causing extremely tiny tears in the muscle’s tendon at the point where it attaches to the outside of the elbow. These tears lead to inflammation and pain.

Tennis elbow can be triggered by any activity that involves repetitive twisting of the wrist. These activities may include:

Orthopedic Institute of Pennsylvania (P),Private,W17,"Tennis elbow, also known as lateral epicondylitis, is a common overuse injury resulting from repetitive motion involving the tendons in your elbow. These tendons, the extensor carpi radialis brevis and extensor digitorum communis of the forearm, extend and stabilize the wrist as they anchor your muscles to your bones. When the attachment site weakens, you start to experience pain and tenderness while engaged in everyday activities involving gripping, grasping or lifting.

The first documented reference to tennis elbow was published in 1883, noting that frequent tennis players presented with pain in and around the elbow area of their racquet arm. Subsequent studies observed that using inappropriately matched equipment for one’s body size and muscle strength, gripping the racket too hard, hitting the ball off center and using poor technique on ground strokes increased the likelihood of tennis elbow pain.

Tennis elbow is most common in people ages 30 to 50, although the condition can be seen in people of all ages. Depending upon their activity level, children and senior citizens can be diagnosed with tennis elbow as well. There is no gender-related component to tennis elbow, and men and women are equally likely to be diagnosed with the condition.

Overuse is the most common cause of tennis elbow pain. When you frequently engage in activities that place stress on the tendon attachments and the muscle-tendon unit, microscopic tears form in the tendon where it is attached to the bone. These tears lead to the inflammation and pain associated with tennis elbow. Typically, overuse is defined as a high activity level three or more times per week with activity lasting 30 minutes or more per session. A poor overall fitness level can exacerbate the problems caused by overuse of the forearm and elbow area.

Tennis elbow pain can sometimes be linked to specific injuries or traumas. If you suffer a direct blow to the elbow, this could result in the swelling of the tendon and subsequent degeneration. When seeking treatment for your condition, it is important to inform your doctor of any injury or trauma that could be linked to the development of tennis elbow.

Finally, as with many medical conditions, genetics play a role in the development of tennis elbow. Some people are born with tendons that are naturally less durable, which makes them prone to developing the condition at an earlier age or in conjunction with pain in the shoulders and feet.",,,

If you have pain on the outside of your elbow, you may have tennis elbow.

Tennis elbow is when there is a tear or swelling in the tendons that attach the muscle of the forearm to the bone in the upper arm. It is caused by repeated use of the muscles around the elbow.

If you stop doing whatever has caused the injury, tennis elbow usually gets better without treatment, but recovery can be slow, taking anything from a few months to 2 years.

What causes tennis elbow?
You can get tennis elbow pain from playing tennis or from using your wrist and forearm a lot in other activities such as gardening, painting and other racquet sports.

You may also get tennis elbow if your work involves repeated movements of the wrist and forearm such as butchery, carpentry and plumbing.

Repetitive use of a computer keyboard or mouse is another possible cause.

How can tennis elbow be treated and prevented?
If you have tennis elbow, it may go away on its own without treatment. You do not need to immobilise the elbow with a sling. The Royal Australian College of General Practitioners (RACGP) suggests that you remain active, but avoid actions that cause significant pain and don’t lift heavy objects with your hands facing down.

Using an ice pack regularly and taking pain relievers can help. You may choose to use non-steroidal anti-inflammatories (NSAIDs), but research has not been able to clearly show that they definitely help recovery.

If your pain persists, and certainly if it has not improved after 6 to 12 weeks, it is advisable to see a physiotherapist. A physiotherapist can suggest exercises to stretch and strengthen the muscles in the arm, and may recommend that you wear a brace or strap on your forearm to reduce stress on the painful area.

If your pain is severe and does not improve, your doctor may suggest corticosteroid injections, although these are only used for short-term relief. Another type of therapy, called platelet-rich plasma injections, may also be an option.

Surgery for tennis elbow is rarely needed, but might be used if other treatments do not work over several months.

Your doctor or physiotherapist may also suggest ways you can change how you do certain tasks, to reduce the strain on your arm.",,,

,,,,UCSF,W22,"Tennis elbow, also called lateral epicondylitis, is a common condition involving the muscles and tendons of the outer forearm, just below the elbow. A tendon is a tough band of tissue that connects muscle to bone. The tendons involved in tennis elbow attach the extensor muscles of the forearm to the prominent outer part of the elbow bone, called the lateral epicondyle. Repeated contraction of the forearm extensor muscles – used when extending the wrist (pulling the hand back, as in the hand signal to stop traffic) and with gripping or twisting movements – can lead to tiny tears in the tendon that cause pain at the lateral elbow. Pain may spread into the forearm and wrist. Despite the name, tennis elbow affects many people who never play tennis.

The exact tendon most commonly involved in tennis elbow connects to a muscle called the extensor carpi radialis brevis. This muscle becomes overused with repetitive arm and wrist movements, such as in painting; using hand tools, such as screwdrivers and hammers; or from long hours of manipulating a computer mouse. In racket sports like tennis, the tendon is overstressed when a player uses an improper grip or backhand technique."
,,,,Columbia,W23,"Lateral epicondylitis, also known as tennis elbow, is characterized by pain on the outside (lateral side) of the elbow. The pain is caused by damage to the tendons that bend the wrist backward away from the palm. A tendon is a tough cord of tissue that connects muscles to bones. The tendon most likely involved in tennis elbow is called the extensor carpi radialis brevis, and this condition is usually diagnosed in both men and women between the ages of 30 years to 50 years.

Tennis elbow, as the name implies, often is caused by the force of the tennis racket hitting balls in the backhand position. The forearm muscles, which attach to the outside of the elbow, may become sore from excessive strain. When making a backhand stroke in tennis, the tendons that roll over the end of the elbow can become damaged. Tennis elbow may be caused by the following:

Improper backhand stroke

Weak shoulder and wrist muscles

Using a racket that is too tightly strung or too short, such as one that is meant for racquetball or squash

Hitting the ball off center on the racket or hitting heavy, wet balls

?However, many people who suffer from lateral epicondylitis do not play tennis. The condition is caused by any repetitive movement. Other causes of tennis elbow include:

,,,,DrBesh,W25,"Tennis elbow or lateral epicondylitis is tendinitis of the outside of the elbow joint due to repetitive arm and wrist movement. It is an overuse muscle strain injury that occurs after the repeated contraction of the forearm muscles that you use to straighten and raise your hand and wrist. Consequently, the repetitive overuse of these muscles causes inflammation of the tendons, the connective tissue between the muscle and the bone, resulting in an overuse injury. 

Tennis elbow is mainly caused by repetitive use during tennis or any other activity that uses the hand or wrist muscles. These muscles share a common tendon that is connected to the portion of the elbow bone known as the lateral epicondyle. Tiny tears happen over time and with age, and the body has a more difficult time repairing itself which leads to symptoms of tennis elbow.

There are many activities that can cause this damage, such as

Sporting activities, including tennis and racquet sports.
Repetitive computer mouse use. 
Cutting up cooking ingredients, especially meat.  
Repetitive use of the forearm or repeated twisting of the wrist. 
Most often, the patient’s dominant arm is affected.  "
,,,,Wikipedia,W26,"Tennis elbow, also known as lateral epicondylitis or enthesopathy of the extensor carpi radialis origin, is an enthesopathy (attachment point disease) of the origin of the extensor carpi radialis brevis on the lateral epicondyle. The outer part of the elbow becomes painful and tender. The pain may also extend into the back of the forearm. Onset of symptoms is generally gradual although they can seem sudden and be misinterpreted as an injury. Golfer's elbow is a similar condition that affects the inside of the elbow.

Enthesopathies are idiopathic, meaning science has not yet determined the cause. Enthesopathies are most common in middle age (ages 35 to 60).

It is often stated that the condition is caused by excessive use of the muscles of the back of the forearm, but this is not supported by experimental evidence and is a common misinterpretation or unhelpful thought about symptoms. It may be associated with work or sports, classically racquet sports, but most people with the condition are not exposed to these activities.

Enthesopathy of the extensor carpi radialis brevis origin is idiopathic, meaning that it has no known cause.

Traditionally, people have speculated that tennis elbow is a type of repetitive strain injury resulting from tendon overuse and failed healing of the tendon, but there is no evidence of injury or repair on histopathology, and misinterpretation of painful activities as a source of damage is common.

Other speculative risk factors for lateral epicondylitis include taking up tennis later in life, unaccustomed strenuous activity, decreased mental chronometry and speed and repetitive eccentric contraction of muscle (controlled lengthening of a muscle group)"
,,,,Dignity Health,W27,"Tennis elbow, also called lateral epicondylitis, affects the elbow and forearm. It is so named because repetitive movements of the forearm — like hitting a tennis ball with a racket — can cause pain and swelling in the tendons and ligaments.

The most common cause of tennis elbow is inflammation, or swelling, in the tendons and ligaments that surround your elbow joint.

Tennis elbow can also come from damage to the muscles in the forearm, especially in the area where they attach to the upper arm bone on the outside of the elbow.

Tennis elbow often develops from forceful, repetitive motion of the forearm.

Very rarely, tennis elbow may develop without this kind of injury or repetitive motion. This kind of tennis elbow has no known cause."

,,,,News Medical,W29,"Tennis elbow (or lateral epicondylitis) is the most common cause of lateral elbow pain among men and women aged 30 to 50 years and arises from the repetitive stress on or the overuse (continued pronation, supination, extension, and flexion) of the forearm muscles. Overuse could lead to the formation of microscopic tears or microtears in the tendon at the point where it attaches to the bone and swelling of the tendons that bend the wrist backward away from the palm leading to pain and difficulty in movement of the affected muscle. The tendon most likely affected is known as the extensor carpi radialis brevis.

An individual with a tennis elbow may experience persistent pain and present with tenderness on the outer (lateral) aspect of the elbow which may travel down the forearm to the back of the hand when (i) lifting or bending your arm, (ii) when gripping small objects, such as a pen or a coffee cup, (iii) when twisting your forearm, such as turning a door handle or opening a jar and (iv) when shaking hands.

The dominant arm is usually affected, although both hands can be affected. Pain may also persist when you place your arm and hand palm-down on a table and then try to raise your hand against resistance. A weak grip is another symptom of tennis elbow. Extending the arm entirely may be difficult. Pain on the elbow's inner side is known as a golfer's elbow.

Despite its name, tennis elbow is caused by movements of the forearm in numerous activities other than tennis that involve twisting the arm from the elbow, as in executing the backhand stroke in tennis. Other racquet sports (such as badminton and squash), which involve the same type of movement, and an overhead swing, may also cause an identical injury. Interestingly, tennis elbow occurs far less frequently in top-rated athletes, indicating that faulty swing mechanics contribute to its development.

Tennis elbow has also been reported to occur in sports that involve throwing heavy objects, such as a javelin or a discus. Occupational workers such as painters, plumbers, bricklayers, carpenters, cooks, and construction workers who use screwdrivers, chain saws, or twisting hand tools can also experience tennis elbow. Additionally, gardening shears and butcher tools in meat shops may cause tennis elbow due to forceful contraction of the forearm muscles.

Further, the prolonged use of a computer keyboard and mouse, or scissors, can also cause tennis elbow due to repeated fine movements of the hand and wrist muscles. Activities that involve delicate, repetitive hand and wrist movements, such as typing or sewing, can also cause tennis elbow. Playing the violin, which requires a bent forearm and wrist, may overload the elbow. Direct blows or trauma to the elbow joint can cause sudden and excessive loading of the joint and lead to tennis elbow, although this is a rare cause."
,,,,Sports Injury Clinic,W30,"It is a general term people use to describe pain on the outside of the elbow. However, the specific diagnosis may be lateral epicondylitis, which is tendon inflammation. Or more likely, tendinopathy, which describes wear and tear or degeneration of the tendon.

The wrist extensor muscles attach to the lateral epicondyle (bony bit) on the outside of the elbow. Tennis elbow pain usually occurs where the tendon of the ‘extensor carpi radialis brevis’ muscle inserts into the bone. At this point, there are a large number of pain receptors. As a result, the region is particularly tender to touch. Symptoms are either acute or chronic.

Acute injuries occur immediately after an activity such as hitting a backhand shot in tennis with poor technique.
The extensor muscles on the back of the forearm (wrist extensors) become suddenly overloaded. This causes small micro-tears in the tendon where it attaches to the elbow.

Chronic injuries normally develop over a period of days/weeks. It often follows a bout of intense exercise or unaccustomed activity. For example, lifting heavy boxes and other DIY jobs.

The medical term often used is lateral epicondylitis. However, this can be misleading as the ‘itis’ on the end of the word implies that there is inflammation.

In long-term cases, the acute inflammatory stage has passed and tendinopathy is an appropriate term. This is because it describes the degeneration of the tendon rather than acute inflammation.

The most common cause of Tennis elbow is overuse or repetitive strain. In particular, repeated extension (bending back) of the wrist. For example:

Gripping or turning objects like a manual screwdriver.
Lifting heavy weights during strength training.
Repeatedly performing occupational activities, such as lifting bricks."

,,,,Better Health,W32,"Overuse or repeated pressure on the tendons near the elbow joint can overload these tissues, particularly where the tendon anchors to the bone. If overload occurs, it can cause pain around the elbow, particularly when using the wrist and hand. Depending on the location and severity of the injury, full recovery can take months.

The most common type of elbow pain is known as ‘tennis elbow’. ‘Golfer’s elbow’ is a less common, but similar overuse injury. Despite their names, these injuries can occur as a result of a range of physical activities – racquet sports, rowing, canoeing, weightlifting, hockey, wrestling, swimming – as well as repetitive work tasks undertaken in a variety of occupations.

Some of the many circumstances that may contribute to elbow injuries include:

lack of strength or flexibility in the forearm muscles
lack of strength in the shoulder muscles
instability of the elbow joint
poor technique during sporting activities (especially tennis and golf) that puts too much strain on the elbow joint
inappropriate sporting equipment, such as using a heavy tennis racquet or having the wrong sized grip on a tennis racquet or golf club

Tennis elbow is most frequently diagnosed in both men and women between the ages of 30 and 50. More than 90% of people with tennis elbow improve with non-surgical treatment.

If left untreated, tennis elbow may become chronic and last for months, even years, especially if you continue the repetitive activity that caused the problem. There may also be nerve entrapment in the forearm, which is why it’s important to see a specialist for an accurate diagnosis and appropriate treatment.

It’s also important to see a specialist because the symptoms of tennis elbow can be similar to other conditions such as cubital tunnel syndrome or arthritis.

Such movements can injure the tendons that connect the forearm muscles to the elbow. This type of injury is very common in carpenters, electricians, and construction workers.

Overuse of the forearm muscles, in particular the muscle known as the ECRB (extensor carpi radialis brevis), causes tennis elbow. A tendon attaches this muscle to a bone on the outside of the elbow.

,,,,Hand Center of Louisiana,W42,"Lateral epicondylitis, commonly known as tennis elbow, is a painful condition involving the tendons that attach to the bone on the outside (lateral) part of the elbow. Tendons anchor the muscle to bone. The muscle involved in this condition, the extensor carpi radialis brevis, helps to extend and stabilize the wrist. With lateral epicondylitis, there is degeneration of the tendon’s attachment, weakening the anchor site and placing greater stress on the area. This can then lead to pain associated with activities in which this muscle is active, such as lifting, gripping, and/or grasping. Sports such as tennis are commonly associated with this, but the problem can occur with many different types of activities, athletic and otherwise.

Overuse
The cause can be both non-work and work related. An activity that places stress on the tendon attachments, through stress on the extensor muscle-tendon unit, increases the strain on the tendon. These stresses can be from holding too large a racquet grip or from “repetitive” gripping and grasping activities, i.e. meat-cutting, plumbing, painting, weaving, etc.

Trauma
A direct blow to the elbow may result in swelling of the tendon that can lead to degeneration. A sudden extreme action, force, or activity could also injure the tendon."
,,,,Intermountain Healthcare,W43,"Lateral epicondylitis, often called tennis elbow, happens when the tendons on the outside of the upper forearm are hurt from overuse. Tendons are a tough band of tissue that connect muscle to bone.

The upper arm bone (humerus) has bumps at the elbow. One of these bumps is called an epicondyle. The forearm has two bones, the radius and the ulna. Along with the humerus, these bones form the elbow joint. Muscles, ligaments, and tendons hold the bones in place and are responsible for movement at the elbow.

Repetitive movements (such as playing tennis, painting, or using a computer mouse/keyboard) can cause wear on the tendons. Over time, they can tear. These small tears add up and eventually cause pain in the place where the tendons meet the bone. Sometimes the pain is sudden. Most of the time, it starts as mild irritation and gets worse. The pain can also spread through your forearm to your wrist, making it difficult to do simple tasks, such as hold an item or shake hands.

Anyone who twists their wrist over and over, especially if that twisting requires strength, is at risk for tennis elbow.

It usually affects people between the ages of 35 and 54. Athletes, painters, plumbers, mechanics, and people who use a computer mouse for long periods of time are more likely to get tennis elbow.

Tennis elbow is caused by overuse of the tendons of the upper forearm. Playing tennis is one way to get tennis elbow, but many people with this condition have jobs or hobbies that require using the forearm in a repetitive way."
,,,,MyActionPT,W44,"Tennis elbow is a painful condition caused by overuse of the ""extensor"" muscles in your arm and forearm, particularly where the tendons attach to rounded projections of bone (epicondyles) on the outside or lateral aspect of the elbow. The muscles you use to grip, twist, and carry objects with your hand all attach to the ""lateral epicondyle"" at the elbow. That's why a movement of the wrist or hand can actually cause pain in the elbow.

Prolonged use of the wrist and hand, such as when using a computer or operating machinery —and, of course, playing tennis with an improper grip or technique—can lead to tennis elbow. It can happen to athletes, non-athletes, children, and adults. It occurs more often in men than women, and most commonly affects people between the ages of 30 and 50."
,,,,ADVTennis,W45,"Playing tennis, like any sport can lead to injury. One of the most common injuries as a result of playing tennis is tennis elbow. The first thing we need to clear up is that despite the name, this injury is not specific to tennis and can come as a result of doing a number of different activities.

The main reason why tennis elbow occurs is due to overuse of the tendons and muscles in the forearm. The muscles and tendons are attached or close to the elbow joint and are commonly used when playing tennis, especially when hitting a backhand shot. Playing this shot over and over again can lead to excessive strain and pain in the forearm, hence the name tennis elbow.

As highlighted above, the most common cause of tennis elbow is excessive strain on the muscles and tendons in the forearm, surrounding the elbow. This can happen from other activities outside of tennis but what are the specific causes of tennis elbow for tennis players?

One of the major causes of tennis elbow is poor technique when playing backhand shots. A poor technique often means the arm is not in the correct position to play the shot and that you're using too much of your forearm muscles instead of your entire arm / body rotation. This can lead to increased twisting and tension of the muscles and tendons in the forearm and around the elbow. It is fine to enjoy a good laugh when someone plays a bad backhand shot but you must know and employ the correct technique to avoid injury.

It is important that the tension of the strings in your tennis racket are appropriate. If the strings are too tight or too loose this can lead to an increased chance of suffering tennis elbow. In addition, regularly hitting the ball off centre when playing shots can increase the chances of getting tennis elbow.

If you have any of the symptoms above and after reading the causes you believe you could be suffering from tennis elbow you should visit your doctor. "
,,,,Englewood Ortho,W46,"Tennis elbow, or lateral epicondylitis, is a painful condition of the elbow caused by overuse. Not surprisingly, playing tennis or other racquet sports can cause this condition. However, several other sports and activities can also put you at risk.Tennis elbow is an inflammation of the tendons that join the forearm muscles on the outside of the elbow. The forearm muscles and tendons become damaged from overuse — repeating the same motions again and again. This leads to pain and tenderness on the outside of the elbow. 
There are many treatment options for tennis elbow. In most cases, treatment involves a team approach. Primary doctors, physical therapists, and, in some cases, surgeons work together to provide the most effective care.

Recent studies show that tennis elbow is often due to damage to a specific forearm muscle. The extensor carpi radialis brevis (ECRB) muscle helps stabilize the wrist when the elbow is straight. This occurs during a tennis groundstroke, for example. When the ECRB is weakened from overuse, microscopic tears form in the tendon where it attaches to the lateral epicondyle. This leads to inflammation and pain.

The ECRB may also be at increased risk for damage because of its position. As the elbow bends and straightens, the muscle rubs against bony bumps. This can cause gradual wear and tear of the muscle over time.

Activities
Athletes are not the only people who get tennis elbow. Many people with tennis elbow participate in work or recreational activities that require repetitive and vigorous use of the forearm muscle.

Painters, plumbers, and carpenters are particularly prone to developing tennis elbow. Studies have shown that auto workers, cooks, and even butchers get tennis elbow more often than the rest of the population. It is thought that the repetition and weight lifting required in these occupations leads to injury.

Age
Most people who get tennis elbow are between the ages of 30 and 50, although anyone can get tennis elbow if they have the risk factors. In racquet sports like tennis, improper stroke technique and improper equipment may be risk factors.

Unknown
Lateral epicondylitis can occur without any recognized repetitive injury. This occurrence is called “insidious” or of an unknown cause."
,,,,Harvard Health,W47,"Tennis elbow is the common term for lateral epicondylitis, an inflammatory condition of the tendon that connects the extensor muscles of the lower arm to a bony prominence on the outside of the elbow called the lateral epicondyle. The condition causes pain at the point where the tendon attaches to the epicondyle. The pain may radiate to the forearm and wrist, and in severe cases, grip strength may lessen. It can become difficult to perform simple actions like lifting a cup, turning a key, or shaking hands.

As many as half of all people who play racket sports have the condition, but most people who have tennis elbow didn't acquire it by playing tennis, squash, or racquetball. It can result from any activity that involves twisting or gripping motions in which the forearm muscles are repeatedly contracted against resistance, such as pruning bushes or pulling weeds, using a screwdriver, or playing a violin. Tennis elbow is an occupational hazard for professional gardeners, dentists, and carpenters."
,,,,AdvancedCardioPrimary,W48,"Tennis elbow is pain that occurs on the outside (lateral aspect) of the elbow, close to where the upper arm and elbow come together. The condition is common in tennis players because of the way tennis players swing their rackets (backhand strokes are usually the culprit), but it can occur in anyone who uses their elbow to excess. Constant twisting of the wrist, (as occurs when using a screwdriver, for example) can cause tennis elbow, so painters, construction workers, cooks and other workers who use their forearm muscles a lot are particularly vulnerable to tennis elbow. Tennis elbow can also occur from a one-time activity such as raking the lawn if it is done to excess. Using a mouse and computer keyboard too much can also give rise to inflammation.

Muscles in your forearm attach to the bone via tendons at the outside of the elbow. Excessive use of your elbow results in tiny tears in these tendons (may be one tendon, or more than one tendon affected). These tiny tears lead to inflammation and irritation and give rise to the symptoms of tennis elbow."
,,,,Jacksonville Ortho Institute,W49,"The onset is generally from overuse of the extensor muscle group that attaches at the lateral epicondyle, or the outer bone at the elbow. Pain may be localized at this attachment site and/or can travel down the forearm and into the wrist as well.  Please watch this informational video about Tennis Elbow. 

Microtears of the soft and connective tissue are often associated with this injury as well.

The causes of tennis elbow can vary.  The most common cause is a cumulative or degenerative overuse of the wrist extensor muscles, in particular the Extensor Carpi Radialis Brevis or ECRB.  This can be an acute repetitive activity, such as painting a room or a gradual onset after years of use. Although less common, tennis elbow can also be caused by an acute trauma to the outside of the elbow (called the lateral epicondyle). This can damage the tendon and lead to symptoms of tennis elbow.  With tennis, this can be related to the grip of the racquet, changing racquets, the tension of your strings, micro tearing of the tendon and sometimes playing too much tennis.  Other causes can be repetitive forces on the elbow such as the clicking of your mouse on your computer.  Another repetitive cause can be activities such as painting or pruning bushes in your yard.

,,,,BWH,W50,"Tennis elbow (lateral epicondylitis) is swelling of the tendons that bend your wrist backward away from your palm.

A tendon is a tough cord of tissue that connects muscles to bones. The tendon most likely involved in tennis elbow is called the exterior carpi radialis brevis. Tennis elbow is usually diagnosed in both men and women between ages 30 to 50.

Tennis elbow, as the name implies, is often caused by the force of the tennis racket hitting balls in the backhand position. Your forearm muscles, which attach to the outside of your elbow, may become sore from excessive strain. When making a backhand stroke in tennis, the tendons that roll over the end of our elbow can become damaged. Tennis elbow may be caused by:

Incorrect backhand stroke

Weak shoulder and wrist muscles

Using a tennis racket that is too tightly strung or too short

Other racquet sports, like racquetball or squash

Hitting the ball off center on the racket, or hitting heavy, wet balls

However, many people who suffer from tennis elbow don't play tennis. The problem can be caused by any repetitive movement. Other causes of tennis elbow include:

Painting with a brush or roller

Working a chain saw

Frequent use of other hand tools on a regular basis

Using repeated hand motions in various types of work, such as butchers, musicians, dentists, auto workers, and carpenters
