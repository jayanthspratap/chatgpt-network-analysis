Mayo Clinic,W1,"Tennis elbow (lateral epicondylitis) is a painful condition that occurs when tendons in your elbow are overloaded, usually by repetitive motions of the wrist and arm.

Despite its name, athletes aren't the only people who develop tennis elbow. People whose jobs feature the types of motions that can lead to tennis elbow include plumbers, painters, carpenters and butchers.

The pain of tennis elbow occurs primarily where the tendons of your forearm muscles attach to a bony bump on the outside of your elbow. Pain can also spread into your forearm and wrist.

Rest and over-the-counter pain relievers often help relieve tennis elbow. If conservative treatments don't help or if symptoms are disabling, your doctor might suggest surgery.

Tennis elbow is an overuse and muscle strain injury. The cause is repeated contraction of the forearm muscles that you use to straighten and raise your hand and wrist. The repeated motions and stress to the tissue may result in a series of tiny tears in the tendons that attach the forearm muscles to the bony prominence at the outside of your elbow.

As the name suggests, playing tennis — especially repeated use of the backhand stroke with poor technique — is one possible cause of tennis elbow. However, many other common arm motions can cause tennis elbow, including:

Using plumbing tools
Painting
Driving screws
Cutting up cooking ingredients, particularly meat
Repetitive computer mouse use
Risk factors
Factors that may increase your risk of tennis elbow include:

Age. While tennis elbow affects people of all ages, it's most common in adults between the ages of 30 and 50.
Occupation. People who have jobs that involve repetitive motions of the wrist and arm are more likely to develop tennis elbow. Examples include plumbers, painters, carpenters, butchers and cooks.
Certain sports. Participating in racket sports increases your risk of tennis elbow, especially if you employ poor stroke technique."
Johns Hopkins,W2,"Lateral epicondylitis, commonly known as tennis elbow, is swelling of the tendons that bend your wrist backward away from your palm.

A tendon is a tough cord of tissue that connects muscles to bones. The tendon most likely involved in tennis elbow is called the extensor carpi radialis brevis. Tennis elbow is usually diagnosed in both men and women between the ages of 30 and 50 years.Tennis elbow, as the name implies, is often caused by the force of the tennis racket hitting balls in the backhand position. Your forearm muscles, which attach to the outside of your elbow, may become sore from excessive strain. When making a backhand stroke in tennis, the tendons that roll over the end of our elbow can become damaged. Tennis elbow may be caused by: Improper backhand stroke. Weak shoulder and wrist muscles. Using a tennis racket that is too tightly strung or too short. Other racquet sports, like racquetball or squash. Hitting the ball off center on the racket, or hitting heavy, wet balls. However, many people who suffer from tennis elbow do not play tennis. The problem can be caused by any repetitive movement. Other causes of tennis elbow include: Painting with a brush or roller. Operating a chain saw. Frequent use of other hand tools on a regular basis. Using repeated hand motions in various professions, such as meat cutters, musicians, dentists, and carpenters"
Cleveland Clinic,W3,"Tennis elbow is an overuse injury that occurs when tendons (tissues that attach muscles to bones) become overloaded, leading to inflammation, degeneration and potential tearing. It commonly affects tennis players who grip their racquets too tightly. But anyone can develop this painful condition, medically known as lateral epicondylitis. 

Repetitive arm movements can cause your forearm muscles to get fatigued. A single tendon attaches this muscle to the bony bump on the outside of your elbow (lateral epicondyle). As your muscle gets tired, the tendon takes more of the load. This overloading can cause inflammation and pain, known as tendinitis. Over time, this overloading can cause a degenerative condition known as tendinosis. Together tendinitis and tendinosis can then lead to tendon tearing.

Sometimes, a sudden arm or elbow injury causes tennis elbow. Rarely, people develop the condition for no known reason (idiopathic tennis elbow)."
WebMD,W4,"Tennis elbow is a type of tendinitis -- swelling of the tendons -- that causes pain in the elbow and arm. These tendons are bands of tough tissue that connect the muscles of your lower arm to the bone. Despite its name, you can still get tennis elbow even if you've never been near a tennis court. Instead, any repetitive gripping activities, especially if they use the thumb and first two fingers, may contribute to tennis elbow. Tennis elbow is the most common reason that people see their doctors for elbow pain. It can pop up in people of any age, but it's most common at about age 40.

Tennis elbow usually develops over time. Repetitive motions -- like gripping a racket during a swing -- can strain the muscles and put too much stress on the tendons. That constant tugging can eventually cause microscopic tears in the tissue.

Tennis elbow might result from:

Tennis
Racquetball
Squash
Fencing
Weight lifting
It can also affect people with jobs or hobbies that require repetitive arm movements or gripping such as:

Carpentry
Typing
Painting
Raking
Knitting"
AAOS,W5,"Tennis elbow, or lateral epicondylitis, is a painful condition of the elbow caused by overuse. Not surprisingly, playing tennis or other racquet sports can cause this condition. However, several other sports and activities besides sports can also put you at risk.

Tennis elbow is inflammation or, in some cases, microtearing of the tendons that join the forearm muscles on the outside of the elbow. The forearm muscles and tendons become damaged from overuse — repeating the same motions again and again. This leads to pain and tenderness on the outside of the elbow.

There are many treatment options for tennis elbow. In most cases, treatment involves a team approach. Primary doctors, physical therapists and, in some cases, surgeons work together to provide the most effective care.

Overuse
Recent studies show that tennis elbow is often due to damage to a specific forearm muscle. The ECRB muscle helps stabilize the wrist when the elbow is straight. This occurs during a tennis groundstroke, for example. When the ECRB is weakened from overuse, microscopic tears form in the tendon where it attaches to the lateral epicondyle. This leads to inflammation and pain.

The ECRB may also be at increased risk for damage because of its position. As the elbow bends and straightens, the muscle rubs against bony bumps. This can cause gradual wear and tear of the muscle over time.

Activities
Athletes are not the only people who get tennis elbow. Many people with tennis elbow participate in work or recreational activities that require repetitive and vigorous use of the forearm muscle or repetitive extension of the wrist and hand.

Painters, plumbers, and carpenters are particularly prone to developing tennis elbow. Studies have shown that auto workers, cooks, and even butchers get tennis elbow more often than the rest of the population. It is thought that the repetition and weight lifting required in these occupations leads to injury.

Age
Most people who get tennis elbow are between the ages of 30 and 50, although anyone can get tennis elbow if they have the risk factors. In racquet sports like tennis, improper stroke technique and improper equipment may be risk factors.

Unknown
Lateral epicondylitis can occur without any recognized repetitive injury. This occurence is called idiopathic, or of an unknown cause."
Medical News Today,W6,"Tennis elbow is an inflammation of the tendons that join the muscles of the forearm to the outside of the elbow. It often occurs due to overusing the forearm muscles and tendons and those around the elbow joint.

Tennis elbow is also known as lateral elbow pain or lateral epicondylitis and is not necessarily related to tennis. However, tennis players often develop the condition because it stems from repetitive muscle use. Half of all tennis players will get tennis elbow in their career.

Tennis elbow is thought to affect between 1 and 3 percentTrusted Source of the population in the United States (U.S.). It usually occurs between the ages of 30 and 50 yearsTrusted Source.

The cause of tennis elbow stems from repeating incorrect movements of the arm. This can lead to small tears in the tendon attachment at the elbow. In tennis, this translates to the repeated motion and force of hitting a ball with a racquet.

Incorrect technique can cause the power in the swing of a racquet to rotate through and around the wrist. This creates a movement on the wrist instead of the elbow joint or shoulder. This can increase pressure on the tendon and cause irritation and inflammation.

Most often, the extensor muscles become painful due this tendon breakdown. The extensor muscles are those that straighten the wrist.

Tennis elbow is associated with the extension of the fingers and the wrist. This is the kind of movement that allows the person to “snap” or flick the wrist, such as during a racquet swing.

Despite the name, tennis elbow refers to any injury to this particular tendon caused by overuse. Tennis elbow can stem from daily activities such as:

using scissors
cutting tough food
gardening
sporting activities that involve high amounts of throwing
swimming
manual work that involves repetitive turning or lifting of the wrist, such as plumbing, typing, or bricklaying.
Sometimes, there is no apparent cause."

Mount Sinai,W8,"Tennis elbow is soreness or pain on the outside (lateral) side of the upper arm near the elbow.

The part of the muscle that attaches to a bone is called a tendon. Some of the muscles in your forearm attach to the bone on the outside of your elbow.

This injury is common in people who play a lot of tennis or other racket sports, hence the name ""tennis elbow."" Backhand is the most common stroke to cause symptoms.

But any activity that involves repetitive twisting of the wrist (like using a screwdriver) can lead to this condition. Painters, plumbers, construction workers, cooks, and butchers are all more likely to develop tennis elbow.

This condition may also be due to repetitive typing on the computer keyboard and mouse use.

People between 35 to 54 years old are commonly affected.

Family Doctor,W9,"Tennis elbow is another name for lateral epicondylitis. It occurs when the tendons that attach the muscle to the bone on the outside part of the elbow swell or tear. This weakens the elbow connection and puts great stress on the area. Tennis elbow often causes pain when you use the muscles to lift, grip, or twist.

Overuse causes most cases of tennis elbow. It occurs when repeated movements cause swelling and pain in your joint and tendons. Any type of repeated motion or stress on the tendons can cause it. Playing tennis is only one of the ways you can get tennis elbow. People who play other racquet sports, such as racquetball or squash, and fencing are at risk. Certain jobs can lead to tennis elbow. Examples include painters, butchers, carpenters, musicians, manicurists, and dentists. People who work on an assembly line or use computers are at risk as well.

In some cases, the tendons can swell after a direct blow to the elbow. In other cases, the condition isn’t related to an activity at all.

Tennis elbow can occur at any age. It is most common in people 30 to 50 years of age. It affects both men and women."
Ortho Atlanta,W10,"Repetitive Gripping Activities
This is a broad category of potential causes. Historically it’s included activities and occupations that involve repeated use of a muscle.

Landscaping
The grip-action of hedge clipping, raking, hand-weeding, and even holding a small power tool stable over time can cause elbow tendonitis in Atlanta.

Painting
Full-time painters often complain of pain radiating from the elbow. Their days are full of repetitive wrist and elbow action as they scrape, prime, and re-paint surfaces.

Construction
Hired laborers on a construction site spend hours hammering, using screwdrivers, and handsaws.

Sports
This injury is aptly named, for tennis players make up the majority of athletes who develop elbow injury in Atlanta. Baseball, basketball, and volleyball players can fall victim to tennis elbow or elbow tendonitis, too, if they’re not careful about using the correct form. The injury worsens over time if you continue to use the muscle incorrectly.

Hobbies
Hobbies are meant to be relaxing, but some of the most trending hobbies of the 2010’s can cause more stress than calm:

Knitting
Crocheting
Tatting
These project-based crafts have recently become a popular pastime. The repetitive motion involved can be a double whammy to your forearm muscles, as you’re simultaneously rotating and flexing. The result can often be an elbow tendonitis condition in Atlanta.

The Workplace
Whatever you do for work, chances are the great majority of it is computer based. Small muscle injuries aren’t exclusive to front-desk secretaries. Pay attention to how much you’re typing in a day and how you move your wrist when manipulating the touch-pad or the hand-driven mouse.

Communication
The primary cause of tennis elbow is defined as, “repetitive gripping activities, especially if they use the thumb and first two fingers.”

For most, the act of holding a smartphone while simultaneously manipulating the screen is routine. It’s also causing you a great deal of potential pain, as you’re asking muscles to work incorrectly all-day long."
MSSPC,W11,"Tennis elbow can be caused by repetition motion, especially twisting motion. What people don't know, is that many different activities besides tennis can lead to it. Up to 3% of Americans (around 9.7 million people) suffer from tennis elbow every year. But only around 5% of tennis elbow cases are caused by tennis.

Lateral epicondylitis, a.k.a tennis elbow can caused by repetition motion, especially twisting motion. What people don’t know, is that many different activities besides tennis can lead to it.

Let’s look at some of the often overlooked, non-tennis-related causes of tennis elbow.

1. Typing

The first thing people think of when they hear “typing” and “pain” together is carpal tunnel syndrome. But people that work at computers all day are also at risk for developing tennis elbow.

These daily, often continual wrist and finger movements activate the forearm muscles. Repetitive use can lead to tennis elbow.

One way of avoiding injury is by keeping your wrist in as close to a neutral position as possible.

Bending the wrist is often where injury comes into play. Purchasing an ergonomic keyboard and mouse could also be worthwhile. Our wrists are often kept in unnatural positions for hours on end, while doing computer work. Ergonomic equipment can help with easing this strain.

2. Painting

Whether you paint for a living or do it as a hobby on the weekends, you’re at risk for tennis elbow.

Using a paint brush and roller involves repetitive strain. There’s also a lot of twisting and bending involved in painting. Those two ingredients are a recipe for tennis elbow.

Make sure that you stretch your wrists and arms before painting to warm them up. Take breaks throughout the day. These should lessen your risk.

3. Automotive work

Wrench. Ratchet. Torque. These all happen while you’re working on cars. And they all sound painful.

Let’s look at the causes of tennis elbow again. Repetitive? Yes. Twisting and bending? Check. Auto mechanics can be at risk for tennis elbow. If you work on cars for a living, you may be at higher risk than a hobbyist.

In this case, using the right tools can keep pain away. Power tools are easier on your arm than hand tools, though using any tool repeatedly may also lead to tennis elbow.  Along with stretching before work, using different tools may lessen a mechanic’s risk.

4. Carpentry

Sawing back and hammering over and over may put carpenters at risk for tennis elbow. Carpenters may have to keep their hands and wrists in strained positions for long period of time.

Here again, tools can make a difference. But also pay attention to your technique. When your job involves repetitive motion, try to make smooth controlled movements. Being herky-jerky with your arms may increase your risk for tennis elbow.

5. Weightlifting

Repetition. It’s in the very nature of weightlifting. Exercises like curls, done with heavy weights, can lead to tennis elbow.

Some exercises can cause more pain than others. If you’re suffering from tennis elbow in the weight room, consider the following advice from Livestrong:

Take a break from lifting
Do less dumbbell exercises
Focus on lower weights and higher reps
6. Golf
If you’re a golfer, you’ve probably heard of golfer’s elbow. But according to Golf Fitness Magazine, most golfers suffer more from tennis elbow than golfer’s elbow.

The golf swing involves a lot of force on the wrists. And that strain is very repetitive. That’s why golfers, especially older golfers, run into tendon problems.

If you’re a golfer suffering from tennis or golfer’s elbow, start with rest. Try anti-inflammatory medication, and make sure that you’re getting warmed up before playing.

7. Baseball
Baseball is a sport well-known for the stress it puts on arms. That’s especially true for pitchers. While you might hear about “Tommy John surgery,” in the news, many pitchers suffer from tennis elbow.

Pitchers put tremendous strain on their arm when they throw a baseball.

If you’re a baseball player, you can avoid tennis elbow by stretching your arm before throwing. Don’t overuse your arm by throwing too much."

Healthline,W15,"Tennis elbow, or lateral epicondylitis, is a painful inflammation of the elbow joint caused by repetitive stress (overuse). The pain is located on the outside (lateral side) of the elbow, but may radiate down the back of your forearm. You’ll likely feel the pain when you straighten or fully extend your arm.

The tendon is the part of a muscle that attaches to the bone. Forearm tendons attach the forearm muscles to the outer bone of the elbow. Tennis elbow often occurs when a specific muscle in the forearm — the extensor carpi radialis brevis (ECRB) muscle — is damaged. The ECRB helps raise (extend) the wrist.

Repetitive stress weakens the ECRB muscle, causing extremely tiny tears in the muscle’s tendon at the point where it attaches to the outside of the elbow. These tears lead to inflammation and pain.

Tennis elbow can be triggered by any activity that involves repetitive twisting of the wrist. These activities may include:

tennis and other racquet sports
swimming
golfing
turning a key
frequently using a screwdriver, hammer, or computer"
The Center,W16,"Tennis elbow, or lateral epicondylitis, is an inflammation of the tendons that join the forearm muscles on the outside of the elbow. Racket sports like tennis and pickleball tend to be a major cause for this injury and elbow pain, but any heavy use of the elbow with repetitive gripping and lifting can be a cause of this condition. It is a common work-related injury for plumbers, painters, carpenters, mechanics, and butchers. Generally, lateral epicondylitis develops gradually, but at times can occur acutely from an injury.

CAUSES
Extended use in activity
Wear and tear of overuse
Improper equipment in sports like tennis"
Orthopedic Institute of Pennsylvania,W17,"Tennis elbow, also known as lateral epicondylitis, is a common overuse injury resulting from repetitive motion involving the tendons in your elbow. These tendons, the extensor carpi radialis brevis and extensor digitorum communis of the forearm, extend and stabilize the wrist as they anchor your muscles to your bones. When the attachment site weakens, you start to experience pain and tenderness while engaged in everyday activities involving gripping, grasping or lifting.

The first documented reference to tennis elbow was published in 1883, noting that frequent tennis players presented with pain in and around the elbow area of their racquet arm. Subsequent studies observed that using inappropriately matched equipment for one’s body size and muscle strength, gripping the racket too hard, hitting the ball off center and using poor technique on ground strokes increased the likelihood of tennis elbow pain.

Tennis elbow is most common in people ages 30 to 50, although the condition can be seen in people of all ages. Depending upon their activity level, children and senior citizens can be diagnosed with tennis elbow as well. There is no gender-related component to tennis elbow, and men and women are equally likely to be diagnosed with the condition.

Overuse is the most common cause of tennis elbow pain. When you frequently engage in activities that place stress on the tendon attachments and the muscle-tendon unit, microscopic tears form in the tendon where it is attached to the bone. These tears lead to the inflammation and pain associated with tennis elbow. Typically, overuse is defined as a high activity level three or more times per week with activity lasting 30 minutes or more per session. A poor overall fitness level can exacerbate the problems caused by overuse of the forearm and elbow area.

Tennis elbow pain can sometimes be linked to specific injuries or traumas. If you suffer a direct blow to the elbow, this could result in the swelling of the tendon and subsequent degeneration. When seeking treatment for your condition, it is important to inform your doctor of any injury or trauma that could be linked to the development of tennis elbow.

Finally, as with many medical conditions, genetics play a role in the development of tennis elbow. Some people are born with tendons that are naturally less durable, which makes them prone to developing the condition at an earlier age or in conjunction with pain in the shoulders and feet."
UConn,W18,"
The elbow joint is made up of the bone in the upper arm (the humerus) and one of the bones in the lower arm (ulna). The bony prominences, or bumps, at the bottom of the humerus are called the epicondyles. The bump on the outer side of the elbow is called the lateral epicondyle.

Lateral epicondylitis is a condition that causes pain and tenderness at the prominence on the outer part of the elbow. The condition occurs as a result of overusing the forearm muscles that straighten and raise the hand and wrist. When tendinopathy, or fiber microtearing, occurs at the muscle origins at their point of attachment, the lateral epicondyle. Small tears in the tendon tissue can occur, and the muscles may strain and irritate their attachment at the bone. These muscles act to extend the wrist and allow lifting.

Causes
Despite the common name for lateral epicondylitis, tennis elbow, the condition can be caused by other activities besides playing racquet sports. Many commonplace activities can strain the tendons. Basically, any activity that twists and extends the wrist can lead to lateral epicondylitis. Rarely, a direct blow to the outside of the elbow can also lead to the condition."
CCOHS,W19,"
Tennis elbow is the common term for a painful elbow disorder.

The technical name for tennis elbow is ""lateral epicondylitis"". This term refers to an inflammation that is occurring near a small point or projection of the upper arm bone (humerus) just above the elbow joint on the outer side of the arm. However, pain can also occur in the forearm and wrist.

The pain from tennis elbow comes mainly from injured or damaged tendons near the elbow. Tendons are strong bands of tissue that connect muscles to bones. When repeatedly stressed or overused, tendons can become inflamed and degenerate. This results in a painful condition called tendinopathy, the medical term for disorder of a tendon. Tennis elbow is simply a specific type of tendinopathy that occurs in a particular part of the elbow.

Damaged tendons can occur on either side of the elbow. When it happens on the outside of the elbow, which is most common, it is called tennis elbow. When it happens on the inside, it is called ""medial epicondylitis"" or ""golfer's elbow.""

The development of tennis elbow is associated with repeated contraction of the forearm muscles. These muscles control hand and wrist movements. They are attached to tendons that connect them to only two small points of bone just above the elbow, one on the outer side, the other on the inner side.

Muscles connected to the outer side of the elbow (extensors) are responsible for:

straightening the fingers,
bending the wrist upwards, and
rolling the forearm into a palms-up position.
Muscles connected to the inner side of the elbow (flexors) are responsible for:

bending the fingers,
bending the wrist downwards, and
rolling the forearm into a palms-down position.
There are weak points in the way tendons connect these muscles to the bone above the elbow. The points where the tendons attach are sometimes too small to handle the strong force of the powerful muscles. These tendons can get overloaded when the hand and forearm are used in strong, jerky movements such as gripping, lifting, or throwing.

Tendons do not stretch when pulled. They are rope-like structures made of strong, smooth, shiny fibres. Strong forces or sudden impacts, however, can eventually tear their fibers apart in much the same way a rope becomes frayed. This type of injury is called a strain, and usually results in formation of scar tissue. Over time, strained tendons become thickened, bumpy, and irregular. Without rest and time for the tissue to heal, strained tendons can become permanently weakened."
HSE,W20,"Tennis elbow is a condition that causes pain around the outside of the elbow.

It's also known as lateral epicondylitis.

It often happens after overuse or repeated action of the muscles of the forearm, near the elbow joint.

You may notice pain on the outside of the elbow.

The pain may travel down the forearm when:

lifting or bending your arm
when gripping small objects, such as a pen
when twisting your forearm, such as turning a door handle or opening a jar
It may be difficult to fully extend your arm.

Tennis elbow is usually caused by overusing the muscles attached to your elbow that are used to straighten your wrist. If the muscles are strained, tiny tears and inflammation can develop near the bony lump on the outside of your elbow.

Tennis elbow is sometimes caused by playing tennis. But any activity that puts repeated stress on the elbow joint can cause it.

Pain that occurs on the inner side of the elbow is known as golfer's elbow."
Healthdirect,W21,"If you have pain on the outside of your elbow, you may have tennis elbow.

Tennis elbow is when there is a tear or swelling in the tendons that attach the muscle of the forearm to the bone in the upper arm. It is caused by repeated use of the muscles around the elbow.

If you stop doing whatever has caused the injury, tennis elbow usually gets better without treatment, but recovery can be slow, taking anything from a few months to 2 years.

You can get tennis elbow pain from playing tennis or from using your wrist and forearm a lot in other activities such as gardening, painting and other racquet sports.

You may also get tennis elbow if your work involves repeated movements of the wrist and forearm such as butchery, carpentry and plumbing.

Repetitive use of a computer keyboard or mouse is another possible cause."
UCSF,W22,"Tennis elbow, also called lateral epicondylitis, is a common condition involving the muscles and tendons of the outer forearm, just below the elbow. A tendon is a tough band of tissue that connects muscle to bone. The tendons involved in tennis elbow attach the extensor muscles of the forearm to the prominent outer part of the elbow bone, called the lateral epicondyle. Repeated contraction of the forearm extensor muscles – used when extending the wrist (pulling the hand back, as in the hand signal to stop traffic) and with gripping or twisting movements – can lead to tiny tears in the tendon that cause pain at the lateral elbow. Pain may spread into the forearm and wrist. Despite the name, tennis elbow affects many people who never play tennis.

The exact tendon most commonly involved in tennis elbow connects to a muscle called the extensor carpi radialis brevis. This muscle becomes overused with repetitive arm and wrist movements, such as in painting; using hand tools, such as screwdrivers and hammers; or from long hours of manipulating a computer mouse. In racket sports like tennis, the tendon is overstressed when a player uses an improper grip or backhand technique."

DrBesh,W25,"Tennis elbow or lateral epicondylitis is tendinitis of the outside of the elbow joint due to repetitive arm and wrist movement. It is an overuse muscle strain injury that occurs after the repeated contraction of the forearm muscles that you use to straighten and raise your hand and wrist. Consequently, the repetitive overuse of these muscles causes inflammation of the tendons, the connective tissue between the muscle and the bone, resulting in an overuse injury. 

Tennis elbow is mainly caused by repetitive use during tennis or any other activity that uses the hand or wrist muscles. These muscles share a common tendon that is connected to the portion of the elbow bone known as the lateral epicondyle. Tiny tears happen over time and with age, and the body has a more difficult time repairing itself which leads to symptoms of tennis elbow.

There are many activities that can cause this damage, such as

Sporting activities, including tennis and racquet sports.
Repetitive computer mouse use. 
Cutting up cooking ingredients, especially meat.  
Repetitive use of the forearm or repeated twisting of the wrist. 
Most often, the patient’s dominant arm is affected.  "
Wikipedia,W26,"Tennis elbow, also known as lateral epicondylitis or enthesopathy of the extensor carpi radialis origin, is an enthesopathy (attachment point disease) of the origin of the extensor carpi radialis brevis on the lateral epicondyle. The outer part of the elbow becomes painful and tender. The pain may also extend into the back of the forearm. Onset of symptoms is generally gradual although they can seem sudden and be misinterpreted as an injury. Golfer's elbow is a similar condition that affects the inside of the elbow.

Enthesopathies are idiopathic, meaning science has not yet determined the cause. Enthesopathies are most common in middle age (ages 35 to 60).

It is often stated that the condition is caused by excessive use of the muscles of the back of the forearm, but this is not supported by experimental evidence and is a common misinterpretation or unhelpful thought about symptoms. It may be associated with work or sports, classically racquet sports, but most people with the condition are not exposed to these activities.

Enthesopathy of the extensor carpi radialis brevis origin is idiopathic, meaning that it has no known cause.

Traditionally, people have speculated that tennis elbow is a type of repetitive strain injury resulting from tendon overuse and failed healing of the tendon, but there is no evidence of injury or repair on histopathology, and misinterpretation of painful activities as a source of damage is common.

Other speculative risk factors for lateral epicondylitis include taking up tennis later in life, unaccustomed strenuous activity, decreased mental chronometry and speed and repetitive eccentric contraction of muscle (controlled lengthening of a muscle group)"
Dignity Health,W27,"Tennis elbow, also called lateral epicondylitis, affects the elbow and forearm. It is so named because repetitive movements of the forearm — like hitting a tennis ball with a racket — can cause pain and swelling in the tendons and ligaments.

The most common cause of tennis elbow is inflammation, or swelling, in the tendons and ligaments that surround your elbow joint.

Tennis elbow can also come from damage to the muscles in the forearm, especially in the area where they attach to the upper arm bone on the outside of the elbow.

Tennis elbow often develops from forceful, repetitive motion of the forearm.

Very rarely, tennis elbow may develop without this kind of injury or repetitive motion. This kind of tennis elbow has no known cause."
Access Sports Med,W28,"Tennis elbow, also called lateral epicondylitis, is a condition where pain occurs in the outside area of the elbow. As a type of tendinitis, the pain from tennis elbow occurs where the tendons in your forearm muscles attach to the bony bump of your elbow.

Tennis elbow is similar to another elbow condition called golfer’s elbow, which affects the tendon in the inside area of the elbow.

Don’t let its name fool you; anyone can be affected by tennis elbow, especially non-athletes. In fact, tennis elbow is the most common reason why people see their doctor for elbow pain.

Any repetitive gripping activities — especially ones using the thumb and first two fingers — can cause tennis elbow. This condition develops over time from the stress that excess gripping puts on the tendons. Tugging motions can also cause microscopic tears in the tendons.

Some common athletics that can cause tennis elbow include:

Tennis
Fencing
Weight Lifting
Racquetball
Other activities that can lead to tennis elbow are:

Typing
Raking
Knitting
Painting"
News Medical,W29,"Tennis elbow (or lateral epicondylitis) is the most common cause of lateral elbow pain among men and women aged 30 to 50 years and arises from the repetitive stress on or the overuse (continued pronation, supination, extension, and flexion) of the forearm muscles. Overuse could lead to the formation of microscopic tears or microtears in the tendon at the point where it attaches to the bone and swelling of the tendons that bend the wrist backward away from the palm leading to pain and difficulty in movement of the affected muscle. The tendon most likely affected is known as the extensor carpi radialis brevis.

An individual with a tennis elbow may experience persistent pain and present with tenderness on the outer (lateral) aspect of the elbow which may travel down the forearm to the back of the hand when (i) lifting or bending your arm, (ii) when gripping small objects, such as a pen or a coffee cup, (iii) when twisting your forearm, such as turning a door handle or opening a jar and (iv) when shaking hands.

The dominant arm is usually affected, although both hands can be affected. Pain may also persist when you place your arm and hand palm-down on a table and then try to raise your hand against resistance. A weak grip is another symptom of tennis elbow. Extending the arm entirely may be difficult. Pain on the elbow's inner side is known as a golfer's elbow.

Despite its name, tennis elbow is caused by movements of the forearm in numerous activities other than tennis that involve twisting the arm from the elbow, as in executing the backhand stroke in tennis. Other racquet sports (such as badminton and squash), which involve the same type of movement, and an overhead swing, may also cause an identical injury. Interestingly, tennis elbow occurs far less frequently in top-rated athletes, indicating that faulty swing mechanics contribute to its development.

Tennis elbow has also been reported to occur in sports that involve throwing heavy objects, such as a javelin or a discus. Occupational workers such as painters, plumbers, bricklayers, carpenters, cooks, and construction workers who use screwdrivers, chain saws, or twisting hand tools can also experience tennis elbow. Additionally, gardening shears and butcher tools in meat shops may cause tennis elbow due to forceful contraction of the forearm muscles.

Further, the prolonged use of a computer keyboard and mouse, or scissors, can also cause tennis elbow due to repeated fine movements of the hand and wrist muscles. Activities that involve delicate, repetitive hand and wrist movements, such as typing or sewing, can also cause tennis elbow. Playing the violin, which requires a bent forearm and wrist, may overload the elbow. Direct blows or trauma to the elbow joint can cause sudden and excessive loading of the joint and lead to tennis elbow, although this is a rare cause."
Sports Injury Clinic,W30,"It is a general term people use to describe pain on the outside of the elbow. However, the specific diagnosis may be lateral epicondylitis, which is tendon inflammation. Or more likely, tendinopathy, which describes wear and tear or degeneration of the tendon.

The wrist extensor muscles attach to the lateral epicondyle (bony bit) on the outside of the elbow. Tennis elbow pain usually occurs where the tendon of the ‘extensor carpi radialis brevis’ muscle inserts into the bone. At this point, there are a large number of pain receptors. As a result, the region is particularly tender to touch. Symptoms are either acute or chronic.

Acute injuries occur immediately after an activity such as hitting a backhand shot in tennis with poor technique.
The extensor muscles on the back of the forearm (wrist extensors) become suddenly overloaded. This causes small micro-tears in the tendon where it attaches to the elbow.

Chronic injuries normally develop over a period of days/weeks. It often follows a bout of intense exercise or unaccustomed activity. For example, lifting heavy boxes and other DIY jobs.

The medical term often used is lateral epicondylitis. However, this can be misleading as the ‘itis’ on the end of the word implies that there is inflammation.

In long-term cases, the acute inflammatory stage has passed and tendinopathy is an appropriate term. This is because it describes the degeneration of the tendon rather than acute inflammation.

The most common cause of Tennis elbow is overuse or repetitive strain. In particular, repeated extension (bending back) of the wrist. For example:

Gripping or turning objects like a manual screwdriver.
Lifting heavy weights during strength training.
Repeatedly performing occupational activities, such as lifting bricks."
Stanford Children's,W31,"Tennis elbow (lateral epicondylitis) is a painful issue caused by overuse. The tendons that join the forearm muscles to the outside part of the elbow get inflamed or damaged. This is usually caused by repeated use of those muscles.

Tennis elbow is not common in children or teens. Tennis elbow is usually caused by repetitive activities that extend or twist the wrist. In children, the most common cause is playing tennis or another racquet sport. Incorrect form while playing can lead to it.
"
Better Health,W32,"Overuse or repeated pressure on the tendons near the elbow joint can overload these tissues, particularly where the tendon anchors to the bone. If overload occurs, it can cause pain around the elbow, particularly when using the wrist and hand. Depending on the location and severity of the injury, full recovery can take months.

The most common type of elbow pain is known as ‘tennis elbow’. ‘Golfer’s elbow’ is a less common, but similar overuse injury. Despite their names, these injuries can occur as a result of a range of physical activities – racquet sports, rowing, canoeing, weightlifting, hockey, wrestling, swimming – as well as repetitive work tasks undertaken in a variety of occupations.

Some of the many circumstances that may contribute to elbow injuries include:

lack of strength or flexibility in the forearm muscles
lack of strength in the shoulder muscles
instability of the elbow joint
poor technique during sporting activities (especially tennis and golf) that puts too much strain on the elbow joint
inappropriate sporting equipment, such as using a heavy tennis racquet or having the wrong sized grip on a tennis racquet or golf club
repetitive movements of the hands and arms, such as working on an assembly line
continuously making the muscles and joint take heavy loads
other factors such as neck symptoms or nerve irritation."
Cooper Health,W33,"Tennis elbow – the medical term is lateral epicondylitis – is a type of tendinitis in which there is swelling of the tendons that bend your wrist backward away from your palm. Tendons are tough cords of tissue that connect muscles to bones.

It usually occurs because of overusing the muscles and tendons in the forearm and those around the elbow joint. Despite its name, however, tennis elbow isn’t limited to people who play tennis. It can happen to anyone who overuses these muscles and tendons through repetitive motion.

Tennis elbow is most frequently diagnosed in both men and women between the ages of 30 and 50. More than 90% of people with tennis elbow improve with non-surgical treatment.

If left untreated, tennis elbow may become chronic and last for months, even years, especially if you continue the repetitive activity that caused the problem. There may also be nerve entrapment in the forearm, which is why it’s important to see a specialist for an accurate diagnosis and appropriate treatment.

It’s also important to see a specialist because the symptoms of tennis elbow can be similar to other conditions such as cubital tunnel syndrome or arthritis.

If you play tennis or another racket sport, tennis elbow may be caused by:

Improper backhand stroke
Weak shoulder and wrist muscles
Using a tennis racket that is too tightly strung or too short
Hitting the ball off-center on the racket, or hitting heavy, wet balls
If you don’t play tennis, you can still get tennis elbow as the result of such repetitive movement as:

Painting with a brush or roller
Operating a chain saw
Regular, frequent use of other hand tools
Repeated hand motions in certain professions such as meat cutters, musicians, dentists, and carpenters"
UPMC,W34,"Tennis elbow is an overuse injury that causes inflammation or degeneration of the tendons on the outside of the forearm. These tendons allow you to extend and lift your hand.

Repeat arm motions cause tennis elbow, such as:

Hitting a backhand in tennis.
Raking leaves.
Constant typing on the computer.
These repeated motions cause tiny tears in the elbow tendon."
Indiana Hand to Shoulder,W35,"Lateral epicondylitis, aka tennis elbow, is a painful condition caused by the overuse of the forearm muscles and tendons, but it’s not just people swinging a racquet who experience this type of tendonitis of the elbow.

Orthopedic NJ,W37,"Elbow tendonitis, also called lateral epicondylitis, is an inflammation of the connective tissue that fastens the muscles in the forearm to the elbow. The tendons attach to the outside edge of the upper arm bone (i.e., the humerus), where it meets the elbow. This type of elbow pain is also called tennis elbow. Learning how to treat elbow tendonitis is a good thing to know before the tendonitis pain occurs.

Tendonitis is caused by overuse of the forearm muscles, but playing a lot of tennis with its repetitive forearm motion is only one way of irritating these tendons. Plumbers, carpenters, and painters commonly develop tennis elbow as they engage in repetitive motions, too. Knowing how to treat elbow tendonitis is useful for different kinds of people who develop this elbow pain.

Other athletes also develop elbow tendonitis — such as golfers and baseball players. The typical age for developing tendonitis is 30 to 50 years, but this varies widely. Every year, 1% to 3% of the population gets elbow tendonitis. Knowing how to treat elbow tendonitis is important for everyone as anyone can develop this painful condition."
Southern Cross Medical Library,W38,"Tennis elbow is a condition caused by overuse of the muscles and tendons in the forearm.

Symptoms include pain and swelling on the outside of the elbow. Treatment will include rest and pain relief, and progressive re-strengthening.

The name ""tennis elbow"" is misleading because the condition is often work-related and sufferers are more likely to be non-tennis players (eg: carpenters, painters, and plumbers). A similar condition affecting the inner part of the elbow is known as golfer's elbow. Both tennis elbow and golfer's elbow are examples of overuse injuries.

Any repetitive activity that places strain on the muscles of the forearm (particularly the outer muscles) can cause small tears to develop in the tendon fibres at the point where they attach to the bone on the outside of the elbow. The tears cause the tendons and muscles to become inflamed, causing pain.

Activities that can cause tennis elbow include:

Knitting
Hammering (eg: in carpentry)
Tennis (particularly the backhand swing)
Squash
Bowling
Painting.
Tennis elbow can occur at any age but typically occurs in the 30 to 50 years age group. The condition affects both men and women equally."
Austin Sports Medicine,W39,"Tennis elbow (lateral epicondylitis) is a term that describes elbow pain caused by overuse of arm, forearm, and hand muscles that then leads to strained tendons. Pain caused by tennis elbow typically appears where the muscles and tendons of the forearm attach to the outside bony area (the lateral epicondyle) of the elbow. Oftentimes, the pain also spreads to the forearm and wrist.

Though the name tennis elbow is derived from the fact it is a common condition among tennis players, anyone from athletes to those who work in positions such as mechanics and carpenters can suffer from tennis elbow.
"
NY-Presbyterian,W40,"Tennis elbow, also called lateral epicondylitis, is a common condition involving soreness or pain outside the elbow. The pain may extend down the forearm to the wrist and hand. Although common among tennis players, any activity that requires gripping with the hand and repeatedly straining the forearm can cause tennis elbow.

Such movements can injure the tendons that connect the forearm muscles to the elbow. This type of injury is very common in carpenters, electricians, and construction workers.

Overuse of the forearm muscles, in particular the muscle known as the ECRB (extensor carpi radialis brevis), causes tennis elbow. A tendon attaches this muscle to a bone on the outside of the elbow. Repetitive twisting motions, whether from racquet sports or daily activities, weaken the muscle, leading to microscopic tears in the tendon and inflammation.

Although uncommon, a direct blow to the elbow could also cause tennis elbow. Sometimes no cause can be identified.

Hand Center of Louisiana,W42,"Lateral epicondylitis, commonly known as tennis elbow, is a painful condition involving the tendons that attach to the bone on the outside (lateral) part of the elbow. Tendons anchor the muscle to bone. The muscle involved in this condition, the extensor carpi radialis brevis, helps to extend and stabilize the wrist. With lateral epicondylitis, there is degeneration of the tendon’s attachment, weakening the anchor site and placing greater stress on the area. This can then lead to pain associated with activities in which this muscle is active, such as lifting, gripping, and/or grasping. Sports such as tennis are commonly associated with this, but the problem can occur with many different types of activities, athletic and otherwise.

Overuse
The cause can be both non-work and work related. An activity that places stress on the tendon attachments, through stress on the extensor muscle-tendon unit, increases the strain on the tendon. These stresses can be from holding too large a racquet grip or from “repetitive” gripping and grasping activities, i.e. meat-cutting, plumbing, painting, weaving, etc.

Trauma
A direct blow to the elbow may result in swelling of the tendon that can lead to degeneration. A sudden extreme action, force, or activity could also injure the tendon."
Intermountain Healthcare,W43,"Lateral epicondylitis, often called tennis elbow, happens when the tendons on the outside of the upper forearm are hurt from overuse. Tendons are a tough band of tissue that connect muscle to bone.

The upper arm bone (humerus) has bumps at the elbow. One of these bumps is called an epicondyle. The forearm has two bones, the radius and the ulna. Along with the humerus, these bones form the elbow joint. Muscles, ligaments, and tendons hold the bones in place and are responsible for movement at the elbow.

Repetitive movements (such as playing tennis, painting, or using a computer mouse/keyboard) can cause wear on the tendons. Over time, they can tear. These small tears add up and eventually cause pain in the place where the tendons meet the bone. Sometimes the pain is sudden. Most of the time, it starts as mild irritation and gets worse. The pain can also spread through your forearm to your wrist, making it difficult to do simple tasks, such as hold an item or shake hands.

Anyone who twists their wrist over and over, especially if that twisting requires strength, is at risk for tennis elbow.

It usually affects people between the ages of 35 and 54. Athletes, painters, plumbers, mechanics, and people who use a computer mouse for long periods of time are more likely to get tennis elbow.

Tennis elbow is caused by overuse of the tendons of the upper forearm. Playing tennis is one way to get tennis elbow, but many people with this condition have jobs or hobbies that require using the forearm in a repetitive way."
MyActionPT,W44,"Tennis elbow is a painful condition caused by overuse of the ""extensor"" muscles in your arm and forearm, particularly where the tendons attach to rounded projections of bone (epicondyles) on the outside or lateral aspect of the elbow. The muscles you use to grip, twist, and carry objects with your hand all attach to the ""lateral epicondyle"" at the elbow. That's why a movement of the wrist or hand can actually cause pain in the elbow.

Prolonged use of the wrist and hand, such as when using a computer or operating machinery —and, of course, playing tennis with an improper grip or technique—can lead to tennis elbow. It can happen to athletes, non-athletes, children, and adults. It occurs more often in men than women, and most commonly affects people between the ages of 30 and 50."
ADVTennis,W45,"Playing tennis, like any sport can lead to injury. One of the most common injuries as a result of playing tennis is tennis elbow. The first thing we need to clear up is that despite the name, this injury is not specific to tennis and can come as a result of doing a number of different activities.

The main reason why tennis elbow occurs is due to overuse of the tendons and muscles in the forearm. The muscles and tendons are attached or close to the elbow joint and are commonly used when playing tennis, especially when hitting a backhand shot. Playing this shot over and over again can lead to excessive strain and pain in the forearm, hence the name tennis elbow.

As highlighted above, the most common cause of tennis elbow is excessive strain on the muscles and tendons in the forearm, surrounding the elbow. This can happen from other activities outside of tennis but what are the specific causes of tennis elbow for tennis players?

One of the major causes of tennis elbow is poor technique when playing backhand shots. A poor technique often means the arm is not in the correct position to play the shot and that you're using too much of your forearm muscles instead of your entire arm / body rotation. This can lead to increased twisting and tension of the muscles and tendons in the forearm and around the elbow. It is fine to enjoy a good laugh when someone plays a bad backhand shot but you must know and employ the correct technique to avoid injury.

It is important that the tension of the strings in your tennis racket are appropriate. If the strings are too tight or too loose this can lead to an increased chance of suffering tennis elbow. In addition, regularly hitting the ball off centre when playing shots can increase the chances of getting tennis elbow.

If you have any of the symptoms above and after reading the causes you believe you could be suffering from tennis elbow you should visit your doctor. "
Englewood Ortho,W46,"Tennis elbow, or lateral epicondylitis, is a painful condition of the elbow caused by overuse. Not surprisingly, playing tennis or other racquet sports can cause this condition. However, several other sports and activities can also put you at risk.Tennis elbow is an inflammation of the tendons that join the forearm muscles on the outside of the elbow. The forearm muscles and tendons become damaged from overuse — repeating the same motions again and again. This leads to pain and tenderness on the outside of the elbow. 
There are many treatment options for tennis elbow. In most cases, treatment involves a team approach. Primary doctors, physical therapists, and, in some cases, surgeons work together to provide the most effective care.

Recent studies show that tennis elbow is often due to damage to a specific forearm muscle. The extensor carpi radialis brevis (ECRB) muscle helps stabilize the wrist when the elbow is straight. This occurs during a tennis groundstroke, for example. When the ECRB is weakened from overuse, microscopic tears form in the tendon where it attaches to the lateral epicondyle. This leads to inflammation and pain.

The ECRB may also be at increased risk for damage because of its position. As the elbow bends and straightens, the muscle rubs against bony bumps. This can cause gradual wear and tear of the muscle over time.

Activities
Athletes are not the only people who get tennis elbow. Many people with tennis elbow participate in work or recreational activities that require repetitive and vigorous use of the forearm muscle.

Painters, plumbers, and carpenters are particularly prone to developing tennis elbow. Studies have shown that auto workers, cooks, and even butchers get tennis elbow more often than the rest of the population. It is thought that the repetition and weight lifting required in these occupations leads to injury.

Age
Most people who get tennis elbow are between the ages of 30 and 50, although anyone can get tennis elbow if they have the risk factors. In racquet sports like tennis, improper stroke technique and improper equipment may be risk factors.

Unknown
Lateral epicondylitis can occur without any recognized repetitive injury. This occurrence is called “insidious” or of an unknown cause."
Harvard Health,W47,"Tennis elbow is the common term for lateral epicondylitis, an inflammatory condition of the tendon that connects the extensor muscles of the lower arm to a bony prominence on the outside of the elbow called the lateral epicondyle. The condition causes pain at the point where the tendon attaches to the epicondyle. The pain may radiate to the forearm and wrist, and in severe cases, grip strength may lessen. It can become difficult to perform simple actions like lifting a cup, turning a key, or shaking hands.

As many as half of all people who play racket sports have the condition, but most people who have tennis elbow didn't acquire it by playing tennis, squash, or racquetball. It can result from any activity that involves twisting or gripping motions in which the forearm muscles are repeatedly contracted against resistance, such as pruning bushes or pulling weeds, using a screwdriver, or playing a violin. Tennis elbow is an occupational hazard for professional gardeners, dentists, and carpenters."
AdvancedCardioPrimary,W48,"Tennis elbow is pain that occurs on the outside (lateral aspect) of the elbow, close to where the upper arm and elbow come together. The condition is common in tennis players because of the way tennis players swing their rackets (backhand strokes are usually the culprit), but it can occur in anyone who uses their elbow to excess. Constant twisting of the wrist, (as occurs when using a screwdriver, for example) can cause tennis elbow, so painters, construction workers, cooks and other workers who use their forearm muscles a lot are particularly vulnerable to tennis elbow. Tennis elbow can also occur from a one-time activity such as raking the lawn if it is done to excess. Using a mouse and computer keyboard too much can also give rise to inflammation.

Muscles in your forearm attach to the bone via tendons at the outside of the elbow. Excessive use of your elbow results in tiny tears in these tendons (may be one tendon, or more than one tendon affected). These tiny tears lead to inflammation and irritation and give rise to the symptoms of tennis elbow."
Jacksonville Ortho Institute,W49,"The onset is generally from overuse of the extensor muscle group that attaches at the lateral epicondyle, or the outer bone at the elbow. Pain may be localized at this attachment site and/or can travel down the forearm and into the wrist as well.  Please watch this informational video about Tennis Elbow. 

Microtears of the soft and connective tissue are often associated with this injury as well.

The causes of tennis elbow can vary.  The most common cause is a cumulative or degenerative overuse of the wrist extensor muscles, in particular the Extensor Carpi Radialis Brevis or ECRB.  This can be an acute repetitive activity, such as painting a room or a gradual onset after years of use. Although less common, tennis elbow can also be caused by an acute trauma to the outside of the elbow (called the lateral epicondyle). This can damage the tendon and lead to symptoms of tennis elbow.  With tennis, this can be related to the grip of the racquet, changing racquets, the tension of your strings, micro tearing of the tendon and sometimes playing too much tennis.  Other causes can be repetitive forces on the elbow such as the clicking of your mouse on your computer.  Another repetitive cause can be activities such as painting or pruning bushes in your yard.
