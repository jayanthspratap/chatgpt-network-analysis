Darrow SC Institute,Private,W1,W1,"PRP injection can help rebuild the thumb joint. A comparison of PRP to cortisone

Above I presented the studies from the surgeons above the challenges they face providing thumb surgery. In this section I will present the options that include Platelet Rich Plasma injections and stem cell therapy injections.

PRP treatments involve collecting a small amount of your blood and spinning it in a centrifuge to separate the platelets from the red cells. The collected platelets are then injected into the thumb/wrist area to stimulate healing and regeneration. PRP puts specific components in the blood to work. Blood is made up of four main components; plasma, red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets. Each part plays a role in keeping your body functioning properly. Platelets act as wound and injury healers. They are first on the scene at an injury, clotting to stop any bleeding and immediately helping to regenerate new tissue in the wounded area.

A 2021 study in the journal Cartilage (8) offered this comparison between PRP injections and cortisone injections. Before I start with this study I would like to point out that many people reach out to me and tell me how painful the actual cortisone injection was for them. The problem is the size of the needle and the size of the joint space. When we inject into this area we typically use a freeze spray and very fine needles. This provides the patient with a lot of comfort during the procedure. Also we do not offer a single injection of PRP. We inject into various areas of the wrist and thumb area to maximize the healing effect of the PRP injection.

To the research – the summary learning points:

Various systematic reviews have recently shown that intra-articular platelet-rich plasma can lead to symptomatic relief of knee osteoarthritis for up to 12 months. There exist limited data on its use in small joints, such as the trapeziometacarpal joint (TMJ) or carpometacarpal joint (CMCJ) of the thumb.
A prospective, randomized, blind, controlled, clinical trial of 33 patients with clinical and radiographic osteoarthritis of the trapeziometacarpal joint (grades: I-III) was conducted.
Group A patients (16 patients) received 2 ultrasound-guided IA-PRP injections, while group B patients (17 patients) received 2 ultrasound-guided intra-articular methylprednisolone and lidocaine injections at a 2-week interval.
Patients were evaluated prior to and at 3 and 12 months after the second injection.
After 12 months’ follow-up, the IA-PRP treatment has yielded significantly better results in comparison with the corticosteroids, in terms of pain relief, better function, and patients’ satisfaction.
A 2016 study from the University Medical Center Regensburg in Germany (9) evaluated PRP injections into the trapeziometacarpal (TMC) joint. In this report, ten patients TMC joint osteoarthritis were  treated with 2 intra-articular PRP injections four weeks apart. Patients were evaluated using Visual Analog Score (0 – 10 pain grading), strength measures, and the Mayo Wrist score (measuring pain intensity and functional status) and DASH (The disabilities of the arm, shoulder and hand score) after 3 and 6 months.

VAS significantly decreased at six-month follow-up
The DASH score was unaffected; however, the Mayo Wrist score significantly improved
Grip was unaffected, whereas pinch (the ability to pinch) improved at six-month follow-up)
 

A December 2022 paper (15) compared the effects of repeated cortisone injections at 3 months and beyond in patients treated for knee osteoarthritis or trapeziometacarpal osteoarthritis to patients receiving hyaluronic acid, platelet-rich plasma, or placebo. The study found the hyaluronic acid, platelet-rich plasma, and placebo injections to be superior treatments 24 months after the injection.

Conclusion: “PRP injection for symptomatic trapeziometacarpal osteoarthritis is a reasonable therapeutic option in early stages.”

Autologous fat injections and Platelet-Rich Plasma injections

A January 2023 review study (16)  compared autologous fat injections and Platelet-Rich Plasma injections for Trapeziometacarpal Osteoarthritis. Autologous fat injections are given to help patch cartilage deficits. The authors of the study write: “(Injection) therapy with autologous substances such as platelet-rich plasma and autologous fat have recently gained increasing attention because of beneficial pain-reducing effects in arthritis and the associated regenerative potential.” In this review study, the researchers found both autologous fat injections and Platelet-Rich Plasma injections “achieved a good and long-lasting pain reduction, which may also be accompanied by corresponding improvement in hand function.”

This case review (10) was published in October 2019:

“Thumb carpometacarpal osteoarthritis is a progressively disabling, debilitating condition presenting with thumb base pain and hand functional impairment. Platelet-rich plasma has been used widely for the management of musculoskeletal pathologies, osteoarthritis being among them.

A 59-year-old male professional pianist presented with chronic, mild onset of right thumb base pain involving a progressive lack of pinch strength in his right hand, and severe difficulties with playing.
Three PRP injections were administered to the Thumb carpometacarpal joint on a 1-week interval regime.
Clinical outcomes were assessed by using standard scoring scales including those for pain, grip and pinch strength
Functional outcome was excellent according to patient’s capability with daily living activities and specific playing demands.
At 12 months follow-up, no recurrences or complications were identified, with the musician returning to his previous level of performance 2 weeks before the end of this period.
“Patient self-reported satisfaction was high and he reported to return to his routine piano activity with no limitations. This case-based review study documents the clinical efficacy of PRP treatment from both functional and perceived-pain perspectives in a professional pianist. Presenting this case, our aim is to draw attention of healthcare providers dealing with Thumb carpometacarpal osteoarthritis to PRP as a safe, beneficial therapy for this condition which needs further assessment in randomized controlled trials.”

Stem Cell Therapy for thumb osteoarthritis

In our experience of over 23 years seeing patients with thumb osteoarthritis we have seen positive results with PRP and with bone marrow derived stem cell. There is research coming suggesting that the positive effects of stem cell therapy studied and documented in the large joints, the hips and knees for example, can be demonstrated in the small joints, those of the thumb for example. This was suggested and shown by research in the journal Plastic and reconstructive surgery. Global open. (11)

Stem cells offered in the thumb region act in the same manner as those injected into the knee. In our observations we have noted:

We found that in the short-term, receiving multiple injections into a painful joint is more effective than receiving a single stem cell injection.
Functionality score increased after first treatment, illustrating that patients experienced an immediate benefit in performing everyday activities with less difficulty.
By the second injection, patients began to report improvement with pain at rest. Patients then experienced additional decreases in resting pain with each treatment thereafter.
The increase in mean functionality score with successive stem cell treatments shows that increasing the number of BMC treatments improves patient performance in daily activities.
Independent research: “Many patients showed improved quality of life and pain relief. These injections appear to be an effective means of postponing surgery”

A November 2021 study (12) evaluated the effect of bone marrow aspirate concentrate (BMAC) in the treatment of osteoarthritis of the thumb first carpometacarpal joint. Injections were carried out in 27 thumbs.

According to the Dell classification (a scoring system to determine the severity of the thumb osteoarthritis from Stage I less joint space narrowing to Stage IV severe osteoarthritis), there were:

2 stage I,
11 stage II,
13 stage III
and 1 stage IV cases examined.
The bone marrow was aspirated from the iliac crest, concentrated by centrifugation, and injected under fluoroscopic control into the pathological thumb. Results were assessed at a average 16 months’ follow-up.

Clinical evaluation comprised of:

QuickDASH (A disability scoring system that ranges from – 0 (no disability) to 100 (complete disability) and PRWE (Patient-Rated Wrist Evaluation – A disability scoring system for the wrist that ranges from – 0 (no disability) to 100 (complete disability) scores, pain at rest on a numerical analog scale (NAS a zero – 10 (worst) scoring system), and thumb column abduction.
QuickDASH and PRWE scores were 59 (range, 27-82) and 88 range, 37-125) preoperatively and 29 (range, 0-64) and 50 (range, 1-99) postoperatively, respectively.
Mean pain at rest on NAS improved from 7 (range, 1-10) to 4 (range, 0-9).
Thumb abduction improved by a mean 18° over preoperative data.
No postoperative complications were found.
Two patients had to be operated on for inefficacy of injection.
The researchers noted: “This is the first article presenting the effect of an intra-articular injection of bone marrow aspirate concentrate in the thumb first carpometacarpal joint and the results were encouraging. Many patients showed improved quality of life and pain relief. These injections appear to be an effective means of postponing surgery.”

Research summary

PRP and stem cell therapy can help many people. A 2021 paper (13) offers us a summary of the research:

“The intra-articular injection of therapeutic agents is an attractive strategy for the local treatment of Thumb-Base Osteoarthritis. . . However, the current evidence remains equivocal. The main reason behind this is related to the poor methodology of the available scientific studies, which makes the results quite inconclusive. Some data supported the clinical usefulness of intra-articular hyaluronic acid, especially in improving functional capacity and of intra-articular corticosteroids in reducing painful symptomatology; new emerging and encouraging results derived from PRP and mesenchymal-derived stem cell populations, but they are still preliminary. At this regard, we auspicate a growing development of the scientific evidence in the field of regenerative medicine until now poorly explored in Thumb-Base Osteoarthritis. “",31.8,17.4,14.4,13,13,14

The purpose of this study is to investigate a case series of patients treated with Platelet-rich plasma for thumb carpometacarpal joint osteoarthritis. Carpometacarpal arthritis is a highly prevalent condition with significant effects on quality of life and function. Meanwhile, platelet-rich plasma has been demonstrated to be an effective treatment for various musculoskeletal conditions.

Condition or disease 	Intervention/treatment 
Thumb Carpometacarpal Joint Osteoarthritis
Biological: Platelet-rich plasma

Detailed Description:
The first carpometacarpal (CMC) joint at the base of the thumb is one of the most commonly affected joints by osteoarthritis (OA), with a prevalence ranging from 15-36% in females and 5-11% in males. It is also functionally debilitating, with symptoms including diminished range of motion, weakness, deformity, instability, and pain. Despite the prevalence of first CMC OA, as well as the emerging evidence of platelet-rich plasma (PRP) efficacy for various musculoskeletal conditions, there is a paucity of studies investigating the two. To our knowledge, there are three studies in the literature, resulting in a total of 27 patients with first CMC OA receiving PRP to date1.
Common nonsurgical treatment options for management of this condition include oral and topical NSAIDs, hand therapy, activity modifications, splinting and intra-articular injections. Injections have traditionally consisted of corticosteroids demonstrating variable efficacy and viscosupplementation resulting in conflicting results. Surgical options include trapeziectomy with ligament reconstruction and tendon interposition, fusion, and less commonly, implant arthroplasty.
PRP is defined as an autologous, concentrated mix of platelets and inflammatory mediators suspended in plasma, obtained by centrifuging a patient's whole blood. It is hypothesized that PRP stimulates recruitment, proliferation, and differentiation of regenerative cells via release of various growth factors such as platelet-derived growth factor-AB and -BB, transforming growth factor-β1, insulin-like growth factor-1, fibroblast growth factor-basic, epidermal growth factor, vascular endothelial growth factor, and interleukin (IL)-12. The platelets in PRP have anti-inflammatory properties with modulators including IL-1 receptor antagonist, soluble tumor necrosis factor receptor I and II, IL-4, IL-10, IL-13 and interferon γ. Although PRP has been used for numerous musculoskeletal conditions, varying methods of extraction, different types of PRP, and lack of standardized reporting on the detailed biologic makeup of PRP has caused difficulties with interpretation and comparison of studies investigating its use. For these reasons, there has been a call for the standardization of PRP in clinical use.
The primary aim of this study was to assess (1) outcomes of PRP injection among patients with first CMC OA, and (2) the biologic characteristics of PRP injectate. The secondary aims were to describe the injection technique used at our institution and analyze the relationships between patient demographics, PRP biologic characteristics, and patient outcomes.",10,21.9,18.5,16,16.2,18
Frontiers Paper,Manuscript,W4,W4,"PRP is an autologous blood product derived by centrifugation of the whole blood and characterized by a high concentration of platelets above the normal levels (Marx, 2001). Many protocols for preparing PRP exist; one possibility is to include the leukocyte-containing buffy coat obtaining the so-called leukocyte-rich PRP, while another one is to exclude leukocytes resulting in the so-called leukocyte-poor PRP which is the standard PRP preparation for OA (Evans et al., 2020). Its use for the treatment of OA of large joints, particularly knee and hip OA, has emerged since the first decade of twenty-first century. The rationale of efficacy of this IA treatment lies on its ability to reverse pro-inflammatory processes and to modify the microenvironment inside the joint, restoring the articular homeostasis (Ornetti et al., 2016). In depth, after PRP injection, a subset of cytokines and growth factors, as vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), epidermal growth factor (EGF) insulin-like growth factor (IGF), platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF), interleukin-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1RA), soluble receptor of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta), and many others, are released into the joint, through the degranulation of the platelets α-granules. Globally, these mediators exert an anti-catabolic and anti-inflammatory action, modulate the metabolic functions of chondrocytes and subchondral bone and stimulate fibroblasts to synthesize HA (Moussa et al., 2017).

Actually, only a very limited number of papers, often with a very small sample size and a not controlled design, investigating the possible efficacy of PRP in TBOA are published (Table 3).

The first one dates back to 2016 and analyzed the effect of two IA injections of 1–2 ml of PRP, administered 4 weeks apart to a small number of patients (n = 10). After 6 months of follow-up, the Authors reported a significant improvement of VAS pain and Mayo wrist score, while no differences vs. baseline were observed for DASH score and grip strength (Loibl et al., 2016). These results are supported by a RCT published in 2018 and assessed the efficacy of two ultrasound-guided IA PRP injections, performed 2 weeks apart, in 16 patients compared to two ultrasound-guided IA methylprednisolone and lidocaine injections at a 2-weeks interval in 17 patients. The Authors demonstrated a significant efficacy of PRP in improving pain (measured by VAS) and function (assessed by quick-DASH) both in the mid- (3 months) and long-term (12 months) with a superior effect of PRP compared to steroids at 12 months of follow-up (Malahias et al., 2018). The beneficial effect of PRP in TBOA was supported also by the case report by Medina-Porqueres et al. (Medina-Porqueres et al., 2019). The Authors reported the clinical history of a pianist affected by TBOA and treated with three weekly IA PRP injections who experienced a significant improvement of VAS pain, grip and pinch strength, and quick-DASH score after 6 months; at 12 months follow-up no recurrences or complications were identified.

There are two ongoing clinical trials with IA PRP for TBOA registered in ClinicalTrials.gov. A single-blind (patients) study with IA injections of leukocyte depleted PRP vs. triamcinolone acetonide and vs. placebo (normal saline) for TBOA started in United States in September 2018 (NCT03196310); no results have been reported yet.

Finally, a double-blind randomized trial is currently ongoing in Sweden in patients with radiological Eaton class 1–3 of TBOA comparing the efficacy of PRP vs. placebo (saline solution) (NCT04218591).",40.8,16.2,12.8,11,12.1,13
Boston Sports and Biologics,Private,W5,W5,"WHAT IS HAND OSTEOARTHRITIS?
Osteoarthritis is the most common form of degenerative joint disease, and is the breakdown of joint cartilage resulting in pain, stiffness and the loss of function. There are no curative medications, and is a progressive disease meaning that over time the cartilage will continue to wear down.

WHAT IS PLATELET RICH PLASMA?
Platelet rich plasma (PRP) uses a patient’s own blood, which is separated into different cellular layers. The final PRP preparation is a concentration of platelets and growth factors. There are many different protocols for preparing PRP, but studies show that to be effective the PRP has to concentrate platelets greater than 5 times normal blood.

In joints and osteoarthritis, PRP acts predominately by anti-inflammatory cascades to reduce pain. The data suggests that PRP may be superior to other intra-articular injections in improving pain and function in small joint osteoarthritis (Evans et al, 2020).

WHAT IS THE EVIDENCE?
Loible et al. (2016)

In this small pilot study of 10 patients, the patients had 2 PRP injections into the trapeziometacarpal joint over 4 weeks for wrist arthritis. Patients had improvement in pain and function at the 6-month follow up.

Mayoly et al. (2019)

In a small case series, 3 patients with severe arthritis were injected with PRP and micro-fragmented adipose tissue into the wrist and 2 of the 3 patients had a significant improvement in function at the 1-year follow up.

Malahias et al. (2018)

In this randomized controlled study, 33 patients with osteoarthritis of the TMC joint received 2 intra-articular PRP injections versus patients with 2 steroid injections. At the 12-month follow-up the PRP group had significant improvement in pain, function and satisfaction compared to steroid injections.

While additional studies are needed there is level 1 evidence showing PRP is a better long term option compared to steroid injections.",48.1,13.1,10.6,11,9.8,11
AAOS,Academic,W6,W6,"PRP Injections Are an Effective Treatment for Carpometacarpal Joint OA

Results from an ongoing study presented at the AAOS Annual Meeting indicate that platelet rich plasma (PRP) injections may be an effective nonsurgical treatment option for carpometacarpal (CMC) joint osteoarthritis (OA).

The study was designed to compare the efficacy of PRP injections vs. the standard treatment of corticosteroid injection(s) for pain relief, functional return, and improved range of motion in patients with CMC joint OA. The authors hypothesized that “PRP might be a bioactive substance of potential merit in this regard.” Prospective study
At the time of analysis, 28 adult patients with Eaton stage II or stage III CMC joint OA were enrolled in the study. Patients with Eaton stage I or IV OA; rheumatoid arthritis; septic, psoriatic, or gouty arthritis; thumb joint effusion; DeQuervain disease; history of CMC joint surgical reconstruction; or terminal or serious, uncontrolled associated medical conditions were excluded. The PRP cohort consisted of 20 patients (3 males, 17 females; mean age: 58 years), 14 of whom had prior CMC joint corticosteroid injection(s) without clinical benefit. Eighteen patients (90 percent) had bilateral CMC OA. The steroid cohort consisted of 8 patients (3 males, 5 females; mean age: 60 years), none of whom had received any prior injection treatment. Five (62 percent) patients had bilateral CMC OA. The patients in the PRP cohort received two intra-articular CMC joint PRP injections, administered 1 week apart. Patients in the steroid cohort received one intra-articular CMC joint corticosteroid injection. All injections were administered under fluoroscopic guidance. All patients were instructed to wear a thumb splint while sleeping for 1 month and to refrain from taking over-the-counter pain medications for 6 months after receiving injection(s). The researchers compared results for the two cohorts at baseline and at 1-, 2-, 3-, and 6-month follow-up using the following outcome measures:
visual analog score (VAS)
activities of daily living function questionnaire
metacarpophalangeal (MP) thumb flexion
interphalangeal (IP) thumb flexion
grip, key, and pinch strengths
The primary outcome measure was VAS score at 6 months. Adverse events were assessed after injection(s) and at each study visit.

At baseline, VAS pain scores, function scores, and key and pinch strengths were similar between the two cohorts. Duration of symptoms was significantly longer in the PRP patients. Steroid patients had reduced MP and IP joint flexion, but higher grip strength. VAS pain scores were significantly lower in the PRP patients at each follow-up visit (Fig. 1). At 6-month follow-up, patients in the PRP group showed a 90 percent decrease in pain from baseline, while the steroid group showed an 8 percent increase. The PRP group also had significantly better function scores (
P
< 0.001) and increased MP joint flexion, grip strength, and pinch strength at 6 months, compared to the steroid group. No differences in IP joint flexion were found between the groups, and no serious adverse events occurred in any of the patients.  Fig. 1 VAS scores at 6-month follow-up.

Based on the results, the authors conclude that PRP injections may be a useful treatment option for CPC joint OA.

“Our findings showed that PRP injections were associated with pain relief; increased function in activities of daily living; increased grip, key, and pinch strengths; and increased MP joint flexion, compared to corticosteroid injection,” said coauthor Marie Badalamente, PhD. “The regenerative action of growth factors, contained in platelet alpha granules, upon articular chondrocytes may be a potential mechanism for these positive effects.”",45,13.7,11.8,12,10.4,12
PlosOne Paper,Manuscript,W7,W7,"We could not find a significant effect on patient-reported pain, hand disability or strength in the short-term after intra-articular PRP injections for osteoarthritis in the thumb basal joint or STT-joint. On a yes/no question of experienced improvement, more than half of the patients said yes. However, even when possible confounders were not taken into account, the mean individual reduction in pain NRS did not amount to two points (Table 2), corresponding to a substantial improvement [15].

There are few reports of the effect of PRP on osteoarthritis in the hand. Malahias el al. [10] performed a blinded randomized comparison between two PRP injections with a two week’s interval (16 patients) and intra-articular corticosteroid injections (17 patients) for thumb base osteoarthritis and reported a decrease in pain visual analogue scale (VAS) from 75 to 40 (out of 100) and improved quick Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand (qDASH) score from 50 to 33 (out of 100) at 3 months in the PRP group. In comparison, the corticosteroid group also reported better VAS (from 70 to 20 out of 100) at 3 months but after 12 months, the PRP group reported significantly less pain and better function than the corticosteroid group. The reported improvement in pain and quickDASH almost are almost in line with trapeziectomy after one year [16], hence a result very dissimilar to ours. Malahias et al. used PRP that was prepared manually at a local hospital laboratory, while we used a commercial kit (Arthrex ACP double-syringe system). Therefore, the concentration of platelets may differ.

Loibl et al. [9] evaluated 10 patients with thumb basal joint osteoarthritis treated with two intra-articular PRP (Arthrex ACP double-syringe system) injections 4 weeks apart and reported decreased pain with activity (VAS) from 6.2 to 4.0 after three months and improvement in the Disabilities of the arm, shoulder, and hand (DASH) score from 33 to 20 (out of 100) but unaffected grip strength and pinch strength. After 6 months, VAS had increased to 5.5 and DASH to 27.

One possible explanation to the fact that our result opposes Malahias et al. and Lobli et al. could be that the latter studies used rather simple statistical analyses and have not corrected the results for confounding factors such as pre-injection pain level, gender, age etc. Malahias et al. has a randomized design which may compensate for potential confounders. However, PRP is not compared to placebo but to corticosteroid and one should be aware of that, despite widely used, there is lack of evidence that corticosteroid injections have effect on pain and function compared to placebo for thumb basal joint osteoarthritis [17] as well as in other joints [18]. Hence, the observed effect in the previous studies could be placebo. It has been shown that placebo is effective in the treatment of osteoarthritis, especially for pain, stiffness, and self-reported function and the placebo for new treatments (like PRP) tend to be more effective [19]. The placebo effect increases with increase baseline pain severity [19]. In this study, we found that the pain level before PRP treatment had the greatest impact on the outcome variables. Hence it is a strength of the study that pain level before injection is corrected for in the analysis. In addition to a potential placebo effect, chance regression to the mean and natural disease remission are possible explanations to the previous observed results of PRP injections that could not be reproduced in our study.

One can question why our study showed no effect of PRP for thumb basal and STT-joint osteoarthritis when placebo-controlled studies have shown that PRP has effect for knee osteoarthritis [4,5]. We have no plausible explanation, and we suggest that this study alone should not be used to dismiss PRP injections for osteoarthritis in the hand, but the effect needs to be further and properly investigated in placebo-controlled studies.

Psychological factors may have an impact on pain outcome. Anxiety, depression, and pain catastrophizing has been shown to predict poor outcome after hand surgery [20,21]. It is reasonable that psychological factors similarly may affect the result of injection treatment. A high rated pain at rest in patients with osteoarthritis can some extent be considered a proxy for pain catastrophizing and is therefore to some degree included as predictor in the analysis. However, a weakness of the study is that we have not been able to correct the results for depressions and anxiety.

This study has several other limitations. Obviously, it is a retrospective observational study with associated risk for uncontrolled biases. The data was collected from medical records and lack forinformation about some factors that may affect PROMs. For example, we have no information on the extent to which patients used splints and of over-tha-counter analgesics post-injection. Further, the studied sample is relatively small. However, it is not small compared to the previous studies discussed [9,10] that, has shown a significant effect of PRP, hence it is not likely that the sample size explains the absence of a detectable effect in this study. Another limitation is the short follow-up. Hypothetically there could a late-onsetting effect. However, we consider that scenario unlikely.

Unlike intra-articular corticosteroid injections that may have a harmful effect on cartilage [22,23], PRP have no documented side effects [6,8] and does not increase the risk of adverse events compared with injection of hyaluronic acid or saline [24]. PRP is not classified as a drug and its use is therefore not restricted by any regulations. Consequently, there has been a flurry of various applications of this harmless and potentially salutary injection, from musculoskeletal disorders to cosmetics. Hence, the risk with PRP is rather an overuse of a costly and perhaps ineffective treatment and therefore it is important to establish if there is a true therapeutic effect. The result of this study contradicts the hypothesis that PRP injections have an effect in terms of pain relief, disability, or strength for osteoarthritis in the thumb basal joint or STT-joint.",43.6,15.5,12.2,11,11.3,12
New England Stem Cell Institute,Private,W8,W8,"A new study published in the journal Cartilage showed that PRP (platelet-rich plasma) injections are significantly more effective than cortisone injections for treating symptomatic arthritis of the thumb. 33 patients were randomized to receive either 2 cortisone injections or 2 PRP injections, spaced 2 weeks apart. They were evaluated at 3 and 12 months after the 2nd injection. After 12 months’ follow-up, the PRP treatment group showed significantly better results in comparison with the corticosteroids.

This study is important because 1) Many people suffer from arthritis of the thumbs; 2) It confirms via research what we’ve been seeing clinically– that PRP does work, and 3) it provides a viable alternative to steroids, which have been shown to cause further joint deterioration when given repeatedly.  Until the advent of PRP there had been very few good options for treating arthritis.

However not all PRP is the same!  Rather than relying on one-size-fits all commercial PRP kits, we make our own PRP to insure the highest quality and most effective PRP, and we tailor it for the individual patient.  Also, not all injections are given the same way, even when done under ultrasound. We’ve been doing PRP longer than anyone in New England, and longer than most in the country. Few have our level of skill and experience. And, we’re nationally recognized experts in musculoskeletal ultrasound.  Let us help you with your arthritis or chronic pain condition.

Orlando Regenerative,Private,W9,W9,"PRP THERAPY FOR HAND PAIN
Up until recently, many patients with hand conditions or injuries turned to surgery or steroid injections to relieve hand pain. While these procedures are often times effective in relieving hand pain, they include a list of potential side effects and risks. With new advancements in regenerative medicine, platelet-rich plasma (PRP) therapy can now be used to treat a wide range of hand conditions and injuries. PRP therapy is a nonsurgical treatment option that uses the power of your own body to promote healing.
Commonly Treated Hand Conditions & Injuries Using PRP Therapy
Our hands are in constant motion, making them susceptible to many conditions and injuries. One of the most common hand conditions we treat at the Orlando Center for Regenerative Medicine is osteoarthritis. Osteoarthritis of the hand can be a painful condition, making it hard to accomplish simple, everyday activities. We’ve found that using PRP therapy in the setting of osteoarthritis in the hand can inhibit inflammation, and stimulate new cartilage, providing long-lasting relief.

A recent study completed in the Biomedical Research International Journal, found that there was a significant decrease in pain scores and an improvement in functional scores with PRP injections for basal joint arthritis. They came to the conclusion that PRP therapy for basal joint arthritis is effective with little to no morbidity.

Some of the most common hand injuries and conditions we typically treat using PRP therapy include:

Arthritis

Basal joint arthritis

Carpometacarpal arthritis

Triangular fibrocartilage complex (TFCC)

Trigger finger

Instability
Benefits of PRP Therapy for Hand Pain
When deciding on the best treatment option for your specific injury or condition, it’s important to consider the rehabilitation and risks that are involved in order to determine what procedure works best for your lifestyle. Many hand conditions are treated using steroid injections. Steroid injections have proven to be effective in temporarily relieving pain, but there are many complications that can be involved with these shots, including joint infection, nerve damage, and tendon weakening. When surgery is used to treat a hand condition or injury, there is usually an intensive amount of rehabilitation that is required in order to regain form and function.

Unlike surgery and steroids, PRP therapy uses your own body as the agent for healing. Since the procedure uses your own blood, there is little to no chance for infection. PRP therapy is minimally invasive, eliminating the need for a lengthy rehabilitation plan. Many patients are able to return to their normal daily activities shortly after the procedure with no issues.
How Does PRP Therapy Work?
Our blood consists of liquid called plasma, along with small components of red cells, white cells, and platelets. Platelets contain proteins called growth factors, which are very important in the healing process when an injury occurs. Over time, we may begin to lose some of these powerful platelets that are in our body, making it harder for healing to occur. During PRP therapy, a concentrated source of the patient’s own platelets and growth factors are placed in the site of pain in order to promote regeneration in the body.",35.8,16.8,13.9,13,13,14
Roberts Family Chiro,Private,W10,W10,"PRP PROLOTHERAPY
With an increase in the number of musculoskeletal injuries, the cost of the treatment is also going up. Therefore, there is a dire need to find less-expensive and more effective alternative treatment methods. Platelet-rich plasma (PRP) Prolotherapy is one of the alternative treatment methods that fulfill these requirements. PRP Prolotherapy is a minimally invasive, cost-effective and efficient method in which the blood of the patient is used to heal the injury. The percentage of blood components is reversed and plasma containing 93% platelets is injected at the site of injury. Platelets have the ability to induce tissue regeneration and repair by activating the body's own repair mechanism.

STAGES OF HEALING
The healing process takes the following steps to heal the injury.

Inflammation phase that lasts for 2-3 days. In this phase, growth factors are released.
Proliferation phase that lasts for 2-4 weeks. It is vital for musculoskeletal regeneration.
Remodeling which lasts over a year. In this phase, collagen is matured and strengthened
RISKS AND SIDE-EFFECTS
PRP Prolotherapy is a very safe method as it uses the patient's own blood; the chances of disease transfer and allergic reaction are eliminated. Research shows that PRP Prolotherapy is not related to the tumor development. Like other invasive methods, there are risks of scar tissue formation, needle breakage, no relief of pain and infection.

PLATELET RICH PLASMA PROLOTHERAPY FOR THUMB PAIN
The ability to touch the tip of each finger with the thumb is what makes humans unique among primates. According to the anatomists, the human thumb is the result of an evolutionary process which allowed the humans to develop the control over the small movements of hand and fingers such as picking up objects between finger and thumb and writing carefully.40% of the hand function is provided by the thumb and complete disability of the thumb is devastating and can be equal to the loss of 22% of the body function. Because thumb is so extensively used, it gets injured very easily and can cause acute or chronic pain.

Of all the structure in the hand, thumb joints are the most susceptible to mechanical and work-related injuries. The physiotherapists are very susceptible to thumb pain as a survey done by the members of Musculoskeletal Physiotherapy Australia showed that out of 155 members, 83% had experienced thumb pain in the year 2000. Basal thumb arthritis is another cause of thumb disability. According to the Arthritis Research Institute of America, 21% of people above age 40 have Basal thumb arthritis and it is more prevalent in women than men. Data suggests that by 2020, millions of people will have daily activities limited by thumb arthritis.

PLATELET RICH PLASMA PROLOTHERAPY FOR THUMB PAIN
Thumb pain is mostly caused by tendon and ligament damage/breakage, inflammation and fractures. It leads to pain, swelling, and loss of motion, deformity and economic burden due to higher treatment cost. Treatment options such as surgery can sometimes cause more complications that can lead to the use of antibiotics and reopen the injury site.

Research shows that platelet rich plasma Prolotherapy is a safe option to treat the causes of thumb pain such as osteoarthritis. In a clinical research, the patients felt continuous relief after two PRP injections at 3 and 6 months follow-up. Platelet rich plasma Prolotherapy is also successful in decreasing the degree of deformity in the thumb caused by rheumatoid arthritis.

PRP Prolotherapy is effective in reducing thumb pain caused by tendon and ligament injury. A double-blind animal research performed by Dr. Liu showed that RPR Prolotherapy increased ligament mass by 44%, thickness by 27% and ligament-bone juncture strength by 28%. Increased ligament thickness and strength lead to the ligament healing and reduction in pain. Prolotherapy is more effective than the surgery in the treatment of biomechanical injuries that damage the ligaments.

Prolotherapy repairs and regenerate tissues and restore the normal motion without the risk of surgical trauma, scarring, and infection. Steroid injections are used to reduce thumb pain. These injections reduce the pain by inhibiting the inflammation process but do not treat the underlying cause of the pain as compared to PRP Prolotherapy which accelerates the inflammation process and heals the underlying cause of pain which leads to long-term pain relief.

For PRP Prolotherapy, the cause of thumb pain is diagnosed, the pain site is marked and the RPR injection is applied under sterile conditions. It takes from 3 to 6 months to completely eliminate the thumb pain after 2-3 PRP injections and it offers a long-term pain relief.",44.4,14,11.8,12,10.9,12
QJM Paper,Manuscript,W11,W11,"Abstract
Base of the thumb OA represents one of challenges to clinicians due to limited efficacy of treatment options. Resulting in OA pain, in addition it can cause deformity, stiffness with decreased range of motion and strength. The conservative therapeutic approach is the main line in management. Local injection treatment could be a good choice because of low systemic side effects and rapid improvement.
Objectives
to compare the effectiveness of PRP versus hyaluronic acid injection in osteoarthritis of thumb carpometacarpal joint based on clinical and functional outcome measures.
Patients and Methods
Prospective interventional study conducted on thirty patients with thumb CMC OA. Patient was assessed by joint Palpation for tenderness with grading from I-IV, Provocative tests (Grind test and Lever test), VAS for pain, AUSCAN score, grip and pinch strength. The patients were randomly divided into two equal groups, Group 1: received single Platelet-Rich Plasma (PRP) intra-articular injection. Group 2 received single hyaluronic acid injection. Re-evaluation at 4 and 12 weeks was done for tenderness, VAS, AUSCAN index, Grip and pinch strength.
Results
This study was conducted on thirty patients with ages ranged from 40 to 70 years (mean: 52.77 ± 8.59). Our results revealed that both groups showed a highly significant improvement after 4 weeks regarding pain relief assessed by VAS, tenderness grading, AUSCAN hand function score, grip and pinch strength after injection in comparison to before injection (P = 0.000). However, these improvement couldn’t be sustained for the PRP group after 12 weeks, there was a highly statistically significant increase (deterioration) in hand functional score from 4 to 12 weeks follow up (P = 0.000) and total score (P = 0.004) , highly statistically increase in VAS(P = 0.000) and decrease in grip & pinch strength (P = 0.000) , while HA group showed a highly statistically significant improvement regarding pain, hand function score , grip and pinch strength after 12 weeks of injection.
Conclusion
We observed clinical improvement in both groups of CMC OA treated either with single dose of HA or PRP at 4 and 12 weeks follow up. However, HA provide a superior improvement with respect to PRP at 12 weeks follow up regarding VAS for pain, joint tenderness, AUSCAN hand function score, grip and pinch strength. So we support the use of a single hyaluronic acid injection as therapy for thumb CMC OA in preference to PRP injection.",49.1,13.3,10.7,12,10.1,11

Introduction
Osteoarthritis (OA) is the most common form of arthritis and can severely affect function and quality of life. Platelet-rich plasma (PRP) is derived from a patient’s own blood and has potential as an adjunct to treat OA. However, research has been limited for small joints such as the carpometacarpal (CMC) joint.
Clinical Findings
A 65-year-old Caucasian male complained of bilateral wrist and neck pain after a motor vehicle accident. His initial exam noted swelling, tenderness and pain with movement at the bilateral thumb CMC joints and anatomic snuffboxes. However, there was no strength, range of motion or tactile deficits during examination.
Outcomes
He was found to have moderate to severe OA bilaterally in his left and right CMC joints seen on computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging. The patient was initially treated with ultrasound (US)-guided steroid injections but did not experience significant improvement. After careful discussion, the patient chose to undergo US-guided injection of PRP into both joints. Follow-up at six weeks after PRP injection revealed that there was functional improvement in both joints as well as objective improvement via the Mayo Wrist Score survey.
Conclusion
US-guided PRP injection can be used as an alternative modality to treat OA of the CMC joints when approaches such as conservative therapy and steroid injections have failed. PRP has not been as well studied as other interventions such as corticosteroid injections, but it may offer less long-term adverse effects and be considered a potential alternative or adjuvant to current treatment modalities.",37.5,17.3,13.4,13,12.8,14
Physicians Rehabilitation,Private,W14,W14,"Osteoarthritis (OA)

OA is a degenerative joint disease that causes deterioration of articular cartilage, that lines the ends of bones. OA affects any of the finger joints, the wrist and the base of the thumb and is the most frequent cause of wrist pain.

PRP is recommended for mild to moderate OA. Studies have shown that when PRP is compared with cortisone injections, PRP was found to be superior at relieving symptoms, and improving function. Cortisone is a powerful drug that temporarily treats pain but can cause degeneration of the joint. There are no safety concerns with PRP therapy, and most people experience a permanent reduction or elimination of pain and inflammation.

The results of a 2018 study of PRP therapy for patients with osteoarthritis of the base of the thumb reported a 90% decrease in pain vs. those who received corticosteroid injection who showed an 8% increase in pain. The PRP group also had significantly better function.

A 2017 systematic review of the literature on PRP therapy for osteoarthritis reports that all the studies reviewed showed clinical improvement in pain, function and patient satisfaction.",46.8,14.8,11.3,12,10.8,12
Centeno Schultz Clinic,Private,W15,W15,"Treatment Options: PRP vs Steroid Injection
The first step in the traditional medicine model is conservative care, characterized by rest, splints, manual therapy, and NSAIDs. If patients fail conservative care, they are often referred for steroid injections or thumb surgery. Are these effective? The toxic effects of steroid injections have been previously discussed in depth. Steroid injections compromise joint cartilage, weaken ligaments, and kill mesenchymal stem cells, which are your repair cells. The dangerous side effects of NSAIDs have also been shared, including the risks of stroke, heart attack, GI bleed, male infertility, and much more. Our procedure, the Perc-CMC Arthroplasty is a nonsurgical treatment option for treating thumb arthritis. Learn more about it here.

PRP vs Steroid Injections for Thumb Arthritis
A recent study compared PRP to steroid injections in 33 patients with CMC joint arthritis. In the prospective, randomized, blind study, the patients were divided into two groups. The first group had two ultrasound-guided PRP injections over a two-week interval vs the second group, which had two steroid injections. After 12 months the PRP group demonstrated a superior reduction in pain and an increase in function when compared to the steroid group. If you have ongoing thumb pain that has been refractory to conservative care, the Centeno-Schultz Clinic has extensive experience in the treatment of CMC joint arthritis. A board-certified physician will evaluate your current symptoms and perform a diagnostic ultrasound to determine ligament laxity.

Medica Stem Cells,Private,W16,W16,"HOW THUMB OSTEOARTHRITIS OCCURS?
Compared to the other fingers, the thumb is distinctive because it can rotate more on its own at the carpometacarpal joint (CMC joint). CMC joint is situated at the bottom of the thumb, and it is commonly known as a basal joint. The thumb joint is held together inside a joint capsule that is filled with synovial fluid. This synovial fluid acts as a lubricant for the smooth movement of the thumb. Thumb osteoarthritis usually occurs in the CMC joint.
In the case of thumb osteoarthritis, the cartilage of the CMC joint deteriorates, and the easy movement of one bone over the other gets hampered. Hence, in this degenerative arthritis condition, the bones rub with one another, and a lot of friction is caused. Lastly, this friction leads to the damage of joints and bones. And the synovial membrane that produces synovial fluid and gets inflamed. In a severe condition, there will be a loss of the cushioning effect. Hence, it’ll lead to the grinding between the bones. Eventually, due to the prolonged grinding, there will be a change in the joint shape.
Women and elders above the age of 65 are at high risk of developing thumb osteoarthritis.

THUMB OSTEOARTHRITIS TREATMENT WITH REGENERATIVE THERAPY
Various regenerative therapies, including cell therapy and Platelet Rich Plasma (PRP) therapy, can help reduce your pain levels and offer faster recovery in a shorter time than conventional surgical treatment methods. These therapies aid in repairing the damaged tissues naturally and regenerating newer tissues in the damaged region. The platelets rich plasma containing active bio proteins and the regenerative cells used in Regenerative treatments are extracted from the patient’s own body. Therefore, there is no risk of any allergy or rejection.
Significant improvement may be seen in the patient as early as two weeks. Regenerative cell therapy helps in bringing the thumb joint to its normal mobility and function naturally. Hence, Regenerative therapy can be the best alternative to thumb joint replacement in some cases.

Arthritis Health,Private,W17,W17,"Platelet-rich plasma therapy, sometimes called PRP therapy or autologous conditioned plasma (ACP) therapy, attempts to take advantage of the blood's natural healing properties to repair damaged cartilage, tendons, ligaments, muscles, or even bone.

Although not considered standard practice, a growing number of people are turning to PRP injections to treat an expanding list of orthopedic conditions, including osteoarthritis. It is most commonly used for knee osteoarthritis, but may be used on other joints as well.

This article describes how experts think PRP works, who might consider PRP injections for osteoarthritis, how to choose a doctor, and the injection procedure. Also discussed is the available research examining whether PRP is an effective treatment for osteoarthritis.

When treating osteoarthritis with platelet-rich plasma, a doctor injects PRP directly into the affected joint. The goal is to:

Reduce pain
Improve joint function
Possibly slow, halt, or even repair damage to cartilage
Platelet-rich plasma is derived from a sample of the patient's own blood. The therapeutic injections contain plasma with a higher concentration of platelets than is found in normal blood.

What is plasma? Plasma refers to the liquid component of blood; it is the medium for red and white blood cells and other material traveling in the blood stream. Plasma is mostly water but also includes proteins, nutrients, glucose, and antibodies, among other components.

What are platelets? Like red and white blood cells, platelets are a normal component of blood. Platelets alone do not have any restorative or healing properties; rather, they secrete substances called growth factors and other proteins that regulate cell division, stimulate tissue regeneration, and promote healing. Platelets also help the blood to clot; a person with defective platelets or too few platelets will bleed excessively from a cut.

There is no universally accepted medical definition for “platelet-rich plasma,” so a PRP injection that one patient receives can be very different than that of another. Variations occur for many reasons, including:

Patient characteristics. Blood composition (e.g. number of platelets) can differ from patient to patient.
Processing of blood. How a patient's blood sample is processed (e.g. centrifuged and filtered) affects the concentrations of platelets and white blood cells in a PRP injection.
Additives. Doctors may augment platelet-rich plasma with substances that are thought to enhance the PRP's healing properties.
How PRP production and composition affects the therapy's effectiveness is not well understood. Until more research is done, patients considering platelet-rich plasma therapy should take time to learn what is known about PRP.

What Does Platelet-Rich Plasma Therapy Do?

Experts are unsure exactly how PRP therapy may alleviate symptoms for certain orthopedic conditions. Doctors who use PRP therapy to treat osteoarthritis theorize that the platelet-rich plasma might:

Inhibit inflammation and slow down the progression of osteoarthritis 1
Stimulate the formation of new cartilage 2
Increase the production of natural lubricating fluid in the joint, thereby easing painful joint friction 3
Contain proteins that alter a patient's pain receptors and reduce pain sensation 4 , 5
It could be that platelet-rich plasma does all of these things, or none. 5 More large-scale, high-quality clinical studies are needed before scientists can know.",42.9,14.5,11.4,14,10.8,12
Hindawi Paper,Manuscript,W18,W18,"4. Discussion
Several conservative treatment options have been evaluated in the treatment of TMC OA in the past [3]. PRP as an autologous blood-derived product can modify the biological microenvironment inside the joint by reducing the inflammatory process and recreate joint homeostasis within the inflamed joint [9]. Several clinical trials demonstrated decreased pain and improved function after PRP injections in patients with symptomatic OA of the knee joint [15–18]. Very little is known about the implications for PRP treatment of OA in other joints. Therefore, the primary aim of this study was to gather first results about the clinical effects of PRP injections for the treatment of different stages of TMC OA.

These first results indicate that intra-articular injections of PRP for TMC OA represent a safe conservative treatment modality. Patients with mild to moderate TMC OA experience persistent decreased pain at six-month follow-up after two intra-articular injections of PRP. Furthermore, these patients revealed a clinically significant improvement of the DASH score and Mayo Wrist score. Patients with a more severe OA graded as Eaton and Littler III and IV did not experience a persistent benefit.

In the current study, we did not observe adverse events after the injection of PRP, except one occurrence of a palmar wrist ganglion, which resolved without treatment. The injected PRP volume was depending on the size of the joint. PRP was injected until there was no possibility to add more into the joint. The applied intra-articular volume of about 1.5 mL was similar at both injections for every patient, however, less than in other studies investigating viscosupplementation [3, 20]. The resulting joint distension was supervised fluoroscopically and resolved after one month when the second injection was performed. Progressive instability of the TMC joint due to weakening of the articular capsule and ligaments can be observed after corticosteroid injections at rare intervals [20]. We did not observe progressive instability of the TMC joint in any of our patients. Considering the pathogenesis of primary TMC OA, further weakening of the capsular and ligament stabilizers should be prevented for successful treatment [21].

The most important finding of the present study was that patients demonstrated a significant pain relief after two PRP injections at 3- and 6-month follow-up. Patients with mild to moderate TMC OA, especially, experienced a persistent pain relief.

Patients classified as Eaton II had been free of pain after 6 months, and patients classified as Eaton III and IV had pain relief after 3 months, which did not fully retain up to 6 months. Similar studies about corticosteroid injection also report limited success for patients with late stages of TMC OA [22, 23].

We are aware of two prospective, randomized clinical trials that investigate the efficacy of viscosupplementation for TMC OA [3, 20]. Stahl et al. demonstrated significant improvement of strength tests after hyaluronan injection in comparison to corticosteroid injection at six-month follow-up. Similarly, Heyworth et al. demonstrated significant improvement of strength tests and pain when compared to baseline in the hyaluronan group only. In the current study, the strength measures did not improve. Looking at patients graded as Eaton IV, the pinch even decreased over time.

A few prospective studies on the effectiveness of PRP on knee degeneration revealed significant improvements in pain and clinical outcome [24]. Moreover, patients with early OA of the knee joint demonstrated significantly better clinical results with multiple PRP injections. Accordingly, patients with mild TMC OA experienced significant improvements of Mayo Wrist score and pain at 6-month follow-up. The better clinical results observed in patients with early OA could be explained by a better responsiveness to growth factors in less degenerated joints with more vital cells. Therefore, it was hypothesized that multiple PRP injections would yield an effective treatment option for early OA [15]. However, further studies with higher patient numbers will have to reproduce our first results and will have to elucidate on the number and frequency of PRP injections for effective treatment.

The presented study has a number of limitations: first of all, the study design lacks a control or placebo group. Second, the results of this clinical trial are based on the limited number of ten patients and therefore have to be interpreted with caution. Third, the subgroup analysis according on to the Eaton and Littler Classification based on radiographic features does not necessarily reflect the symptoms of pain experienced by the patient. However, the strengths of the present study are that all data were collected prospectively and comprise a detailed inquiry about clinical and functional outcome after intra-articular PRP injections for TMC OA.

5. Conclusion
At present, PRP injection into symptomatic OA of the TMC joint is a reasonable therapeutic option in early stages of TMC OA and can be performed with little to no morbidity. This study represents preliminary data to support PRP as another option in the conservative management of TMC OA to restore joint homeostasis in the inflamed joint. Further research should be conducted to confirm our findings and should address the value of autologous PRP injection versus viscosupplementation or steroid injection.",36.9,15.8,12.9,13,11.6,13
ScienceDirect Paper,Manuscript,W19,W19,"Emerging evidence suggests that PRP injection is an effective treatment option to improve pain and function in knee OA 12,13. However, there remains limited evidence for PRP in the treatment of OA elsewhere in the body, including common and debilitating OA of the thumb CMC joint. This retrospective study was designed to provide a descriptive analysis of PRP injection for thumb CMC OA. Our results indicate that PRP injection, using a PRP with minimal erythrocytes and neutrophils, is a relatively safe and potentially effective treatment for thumb CMC arthritis in the majority of patients treated (68.8% of injected joints rated improvement either moderate or excellent). Patients reported relatively long duration of therapeutic effects (mean 15.6 months) with high patient satisfaction (68.8% rated as mostly or very satisfied with their procedure).

Loibl et al. performed a non-comparative pilot study investigating fluoroscopic-guided leukocyte-reduced PRP injection into the thumb CMC joint on a population of ten patients 7. This series received two consecutive PRP injections 4 weeks apart and was followed over a period of six months. Follow-up demonstrated statistically significant improvement in VAS (mean 6.2 pre-injection to 5.4 post-injection) and Mayo Wrist scores at six-months. There were no adverse events reported, and the investigators concluded that PRP for first CMC OA was a safe conservative treatment modality. Our study differed from the Loibl et al. study in the use of ultrasound guidance and a single injection. In addition, Loibl et al. used an Arthrex ACP system, which has been demonstrated to provide lower platelet concentrations compared to PRP 24. PRP cellular characteristics in their series were presumed based on a previous study rather than directly measured.

Malahias et al. performed a prospective randomized controlled clinical trial in 33 patients comparing two consecutive thumb CMC intra-articular PRP injections (n=16) to methylprednisolone/lidocaine injections (n=17)1. They found a statistically significant improvement in VAS, qDASH, and patient satisfaction in the PRP group compared with methylprednisolone/lidocaine (median VAS scores improved from 7.5 to 2.0 in the PRP group from pre-injection to 12 months post-injection, and 7.0 to 6.5 in the methylprednisolone/lidocaine group). They concluded that PRP may achieve a lasting effect of up to 12 months for those with early to moderate thumb CMC arthritis. Similar to Loibl et al. and unlike in our current study, Malahias et al. performed two consecutive injections. Based on a prior study demonstrating decreased effect of corticosteroid injection for advanced stages of thumb CMC OA25, they decided to exclude those with stage IV OA. However, due to the differing mechanisms of PRP versus corticosteroid, and given that 62.5% of the joints with grade IV OA severity in our study were given improvement rating of moderate to excellent, we would argue that this assumption may be premature.

Medina-Porqueres et al. described a case presentation of PRP injection for grade II CMC OA in a professional pianist, along with a review of the literature2. In their described case, three PRP injections at 1-week intervals were performed without image guidance, which has been shown to be less accurate compared to using image guidance26. The patient reported high satisfaction with return to prior high-level function. No PRP composition/analysis were provided.

Sward et al. reported on a series of patients with various thumb CMC OA severity who underwent two fluoroscopically-guided injections of PRP using the Arthrex ACP system 3-4 weeks apart. At three-month follow-up, they found no significant improvements in reported pain, PRWHE score, grip strength or key pinch. The contrast in outcomes between this study and our investigation may be explained by the difference of PRP product. The Arthrex ACP system has been shown to produce relatively low platelet PRP (concentration factors of 1-2x) in several studies 24, which is much lower than the mean concentration factor of 8.8 in our study.

One patient in our study noted axillary swelling 2 weeks after his injection and was later diagnosed with low-grade diffuse follicular B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma. He underwent surgical resection and immunotherapy and is currently in remission. To our knowledge, there are no studies in the literature to date that have identified an association between PRP injection and lymphoma. Given the previous safety record of PRP in the literature and the short time frame between the injection and the patient's lymphoma diagnosis in this case, we think the diagnosis was likely unrelated. Nevertheless, PRP injection has been shown to cause a transient rise in systemic growth factors (e.g., IGF-1), so there has been some theoretical concern about PRP injection triggering growth of latent cancer cells 27. Larger studies of PRP are needed to conclusively demonstrate whether or not there is an association of PRP with cancer.

Strengths and Limitations
This is one of the first studies examining the effect of PRP injection on thumb CMC OA, suggesting that a single ultrasound-guided injection may be a viable, relatively long-lasting treatment for an otherwise debilitating condition with few options. The analysis of the PRP cellular composition in this study provides data on the treatment response that may be expected using a relatively high-platelet PRP product with minimal erythrocytes and neutrophils.

The major limitations of this study were the small sample size, retrospective and uncontrolled design, and low follow-up response on established patient-reported outcome measures such as qDASH and VAS pain scores. Our numbers were likely insufficient to determine whether there was a relationship between PRP cellular composition (e.g., platelet concentration factor or dose) and patient outcomes. Although our sample size was small, other studies investigating PRP injection for thumb CMC OA have reported on patient populations of 1, 10, 16, and 21 patients 1, 2, 7, 28. The retrospective nature of this study meant it was limited to a chart review. The poor response rate to electronic established questionnaires (VAS pain and qDASH) prompted us to obtain follow-up data via post-hoc phone survey responses, introducing the potential for recall bias.

High-quality, randomized controlled trials investigating PRP injections for thumb CMC OA are still needed. These should report on established patient reported outcomes, pinch/grip strength, and thumb range of motion both pre- and post-injection at various points in time extending out to one or more years. In addition, PRP characteristics (cell composition at a minimum) of each individual injection should be performed to contribute to the body of data correlating these PRP characteristics with patient outcomes.

Conclusion
PRP injection appears to be a safe and potentially effective treatment option for pain related to thumb CMC OA. There is a paucity of studies on this emerging treatment for a common and debilitating condition. This study suggests that a single, ultrasound-guided injection of erythrocyte/neutrophil-poor PRP can provide worthwhile pain relief for a heterogenous group of patients with thumb CMC OA. Further study is needed to optimize treatment protocols and better understand which patients are most likely to benefit.",42.3,15,11.6,12,10.9,12

Always consult a healthcare professional for personalized advice. PRP therapy involves taking a sample of your blood, processing it to separate the platelet-rich plasma from the other components, and then injecting the concentrated platelets into the affected area. The idea behind PRP therapy is that the platelets release growth factors and other substances that promote healing and reduce inflammation. Some studies have shown that PRP therapy can be effective in treating various types of arthritis, including thumb arthritis. However, the evidence on its effectiveness is still limited, and more research is needed to fully understand the benefits and risks of PRP for thumb arthritis.
