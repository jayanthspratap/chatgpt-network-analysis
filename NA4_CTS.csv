Mayo Clinic,Academic,W1,W1,"Overview
Carpal tunnel syndrome is caused by pressure on the median nerve. The carpal tunnel is a narrow passageway surrounded by bones and ligaments on the palm side of the hand. When the median nerve is compressed, symptoms can include numbness, tingling, and weakness in the hand and arm.

The anatomy of the wrist, health problems and possibly repetitive hand motions can contribute to carpal tunnel syndrome.

Proper treatment usually relieves the tingling and numbness and restores wrist and hand function.

Causes
Carpal tunnel syndrome is caused by pressure on the median nerve.

The median nerve runs from the forearm through a passageway in the wrist (carpal tunnel) to the hand. It provides sensation to the palm side of the thumb and fingers, except the little finger. It also provides nerve signals to move the muscles around the base of the thumb (motor function).

Anything that squeezes or irritates the median nerve in the carpal tunnel space may lead to carpal tunnel syndrome. A wrist fracture can narrow the carpal tunnel and irritate the nerve, as can the swelling and inflammation caused by rheumatoid arthritis.

Many times, there is no single cause of carpal tunnel syndrome. It may be that a combination of risk factors contributes to the development of the condition.

Risk factors
A number of factors have been associated with carpal tunnel syndrome. Although they may not directly cause carpal tunnel syndrome, they may increase the risk of irritation or damage to the median nerve. These include:

Anatomic factors. A wrist fracture or dislocation, or arthritis that deforms the small bones in the wrist, can alter the space within the carpal tunnel and put pressure on the median nerve.

People who have smaller carpal tunnels may be more likely to have carpal tunnel syndrome.

Sex. Carpal tunnel syndrome is generally more common in women. This may be because the carpal tunnel area is relatively smaller in women than in men.

Women who have carpal tunnel syndrome may also have smaller carpal tunnels than women who don't have the condition.

Nerve-damaging conditions. Some chronic illnesses, such as diabetes, increase the risk of nerve damage, including damage to the median nerve.
Inflammatory conditions. Rheumatoid arthritis and other conditions that have an inflammatory component can affect the lining around the tendons in the wrist and put pressure on the median nerve.
Medications. Some studies have shown a link between carpal tunnel syndrome and the use of anastrozole (Arimidex), a drug used to treat breast cancer.
Obesity. Being obese is a risk factor for carpal tunnel syndrome.
Body fluid changes. Fluid retention may increase the pressure within the carpal tunnel, irritating the median nerve. This is common during pregnancy and menopause. Carpal tunnel syndrome associated with pregnancy generally gets better on its own after pregnancy.
Other medical conditions. Certain conditions, such as menopause, thyroid disorders, kidney failure and lymphedema, may increase the chances of carpal tunnel syndrome.
Workplace factors. Working with vibrating tools or on an assembly line that requires prolonged or repetitive flexing of the wrist may create harmful pressure on the median nerve or worsen existing nerve damage, especially if the work is done in a cold environment.

However, the scientific evidence is conflicting and these factors haven't been established as direct causes of carpal tunnel syndrome.

Several studies have evaluated whether there is an association between computer use and carpal tunnel syndrome. Some evidence suggests that it is mouse use, and not the use of a keyboard, that may be the problem. However, there has not been enough quality and consistent evidence to support extensive computer use as a risk factor for carpal tunnel syndrome, although it may cause a different form of hand pain.",52.5,11.7,9.6,12,8.7,10
Johns Hopkins,Academic,W2,W2,"Carpal tunnel syndrome is when the median nerve is compressed as it passes through the carpal tunnel. The carpal tunnel is an opening in your wrist that is formed by the carpal bones on the bottom of the wrist and the transverse carpal ligament across the top of the wrist. The median nerve provides sensory and motor functions to the thumb and 3 middle fingers. If it gets compressed or irritated, you may have symptoms.

Most cases of carpal tunnel syndrome have no specific cause, although any or all of the following may be a contributing factor:

Frequent, repetitive, small movements with the hands (such as with typing or using a keyboard).

Frequent, repetitive, grasping movements with the hands (such as with sports and certain physical activities).

Joint or bone disease (for example, arthritis, osteoarthritis, or rheumatoid arthritis).

Hormonal or metabolic changes (for example, menopause, pregnancy, or thyroid imbalance).

Changes in blood sugar levels (may be seen with type 2 diabetes).

Other conditions or injuries of the wrist (for example, strain, sprain, dislocation, break, or swelling and inflammation).

Family history of carpal tunnel syndrome.",49.6,14.1,10.5,12,10.2,11
AAOS,Academic,W3,W3,"Carpal tunnel syndrome occurs when the tunnel becomes narrowed or when the tissue surrounding the flexor tendons (known as synovium) swells, putting pressure on the median nerve and reducing its blood supply.  

This abnormal pressure on the nerve can result in numbness, tingling, pain, and weakness in the hand.

Most cases of carpal tunnel syndrome are caused by a combination of factors. Studies show that women and older people are more likely to develop the condition.

Other risk factors for carpal tunnel syndrome include:

Heredity. This is likely an important factor. The carpal tunnel may be naturally smaller in some people, or there may be anatomic differences that change the amount of space for the nerve — and these traits can run in families.
Repetitive hand use. Repeating the same hand and wrist motions or activities over a prolonged period of time may aggravate the tendons in the wrist, causing swelling that puts pressure on the nerve.
Hand and wrist position. Doing activities that involve extreme flexion or extension of the hand and wrist for a prolonged period of time can increase pressure on the nerve.
Pregnancy. Hormonal changes during pregnancy can cause swelling that results in pressure on the nerve.
Health conditions. Diabetes, rheumatoid arthritis, and thyroid gland imbalance are conditions that are associated with carpal tunnel syndrome.",54.5,11.7,9.3,12,8.8,10
NIH,Government,W4,W4,"Carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS) is a common neurological disorder that occurs when the median nerve, which runs from your forearm into the palm of the hand, becomes pressed or squeezed at the wrist. You may feel numbness, weakness, pain in your hand and wrist, and your fingers may become swollen and useless. You might wake up and feel you need to “shake out” your hand or wrist.

The median nerve and the tendons that bend the fingers pass through the carpal tunnel—a narrow, rigid passageway of ligament and bones at the base of the hand. The median nerve provides feeling to the thumb, index, and middle finger, and part of the ring finger (but not the little finger). It also controls some small muscles at the base of the thumb.

Sometimes, thickening from the lining of irritated tendons or other swelling narrows the tunnel and compresses the median nerve. CTS is the most common and widely known of the entrapment neuropathies, in which one of the body's peripheral nerves is pressed on or squeezed.

You can sometimes treat carpal tunnel syndrome at home, but it may take months to heal. Your doctor can recommend treatments. CTS rarely recurs following treatment and home care.

Carpal tunnel syndrome is often the result of a combination of factors that increase pressure on the median nerve and tendons in the carpal tunnel, rather than a problem with the nerve itself. Sometimes no single cause can be identified. Contributing factors may include:

Trauma or injury to the wrist that cause swelling, such as sprain or fracture.
Imbalance of either the pituitary gland or the thyroid gland.
Rheumatoid arthritis or other arthritic diseases.
Mechanical problems in the wrist joint.
Repeated use of vibrating hand tools.
Fluid retention during pregnancy or menopause.
Development of a cyst or tumor in the canal.
Sex—women are three times more likely than men to develop CTS.
Having diabetes or other metabolic disorders that directly affect the body's nerves and make them more susceptible to compression.
Repeated sleeping on a bent wrist.
Increasing age—CTS usually occurs only in adults.
The risk of developing CTS is not confined to people in a single industry or job but may be more reported in those performing assembly line work—such as manufacturing, sewing, finishing, cleaning, and meatpacking—than it is among data-entry personnel. Many people who have CTS report never have working at these types of jobs.",57.4,11.7,9.1,11,8.5,9
Healthline,Private,W5,W5,"Carpal tunnel syndrome is the compression of the median nerve as it passes into the hand. The median nerve is located on the palm side of your hand (also called the carpal tunnel). The median nerve provides sensation (ability to feel) to your thumb, index finger, long finger, and part of the ring finger. It supplies the impulse to the muscle going to the thumb. Carpal tunnel syndrome can occur in one or both of your hands.

Swelling inside your wrist causes the compression in carpal tunnel syndrome. It can lead to numbness, weakness, and tingling on the side of your hand near the thumb.

The pain in your carpal tunnel is due to excess pressure in your wrist and on the median nerve. Inflammation can cause swelling. The most common cause of this inflammation is an underlying medical condition that causes swelling in the wrist, and sometimes obstructed blood flow. Some of the most frequent conditions linked with carpal tunnel syndrome are:

diabetes.
thyroid dysfunction.
fluid retention from pregnancy or menopause.
high blood pressure.
autoimmune disorders such as rheumatoid arthritis.
fractures or trauma to the wrist.
Carpal tunnel syndrome can be made worse if the wrist is overextended repeatedly. Repeated motion of your wrist contributes to swelling and compression of the median nerve. This may be the result of:

positioning of your wrists while using your keyboard or mouse.
prolonged exposure to vibrations from using hand tools or power tools.
any repeated movement that overextends your wrist, such as playing the piano or typing.",62.8,11,7.5,11,8,8
Cleveland Clinic,Academic,W6,W6,"Carpal tunnel syndrome is a common condition that causes pain, numbness, tingling, and weakness in the hand and wrist. It happens when there is increased pressure within the wrist on a nerve called the median nerve. This nerve provides sensation to the thumb, index, and middle fingers, and to half of the ring finger. The small finger (the “pinky”) is typically not affected.

Carpal tunnel syndrome was first described in the mid-1800s. The first surgery for the release of the carpal tunnel was done in the 1930s. It is a condition that has been well recognized by orthopaedic surgeons for over 40 years.

Carpal tunnel syndrome is caused when the space (the carpal tunnel) in the wrist narrows. This presses down on the median nerve and tendons (located inside the carpal tunnel), makes them swell, which cuts off sensation in the fingers and hand.",68.5,9.8,7.7,9,6.8,8
WebMD,Private,W7,W7,"Carpal tunnel syndrome, also called median nerve compression, is a condition that causes numbness, tingling, or weakness in your hand.

It happens because of pressure on your median nerve, which runs the length of your arm, goes through a passage in your wrist called the carpal tunnel, and ends in your hand. The median controls the movement and feeling of your thumb and the movement of all your fingers except your pinky.

Often, people don't know what brought on their carpal tunnel syndrome. It can be due to repetitive motions, like typing, or any wrist movements that you do over and over. This is especially true of things you do when your hands are lower than your wrists. This is especially true of things you do when your hands are lower than your wrists.",69.3,10.9,8.3,9,7.4,9
Mount Sinai,Academic,W8,W8,"Carpal tunnel syndrome is a condition in which there is excessive pressure on the median nerve. This is the nerve in the wrist that allows feeling and movement to parts of the hand. Carpal tunnel syndrome can lead to numbness, tingling, weakness, or muscle damage in the hand and fingers.

The median nerve provides feeling and movement to the thumb side of the hand. This includes the palm, thumb, index finger, middle finger, and thumb side of the ring finger.

The area in your wrist where the nerve enters the hand is called the carpal tunnel. This tunnel is normally narrow. Any swelling can pinch the nerve and cause pain, numbness, tingling, or weakness. This is called carpal tunnel syndrome.

Some people who develop carpal tunnel syndrome were born with a small carpal tunnel.

Carpal tunnel syndrome can also be caused by making the same hand and wrist motion over and over. Using hand tools that vibrate may also lead to carpal tunnel syndrome.

Studies have not proved that carpal tunnel is caused by typing on a computer, using a mouse, or repeating movements while working, playing a musical instrument, or playing sports. But, these activities may cause tendinitis or bursitis in the hand, which can narrow the carpal tunnel and lead to symptoms.

Carpal tunnel syndrome occurs most often in people ages 30 to 60. It is more common in women than men.

Other factors that may lead to carpal tunnel syndrome include:

Alcohol use.
Bone fractures and arthritis of the wrist.
Cyst or tumor that grows in the wrist.
Infections.
Obesity.
If your body keeps extra fluids during pregnancy or menopause.
Rheumatoid arthritis.
Diseases that have abnormal deposits of protein in the body (amyloidosis).",66.7,8.3,6.9,10,6.3,7
Medline Plus,Government,W9,W9,"Carpal tunnel syndrome is the name for a group of problems that includes numbness, tingling, weakness, or pain in your wrist or hand. It's a very common condition that happens when a nerve in your wrist becomes squeezed.

The carpal tunnel is a narrow opening between the bones in your wrist and the ligament that holds them together. A nerve, called the median nerve, runs from your lower arm through the carpal tunnel and into your hand. This nerve provides feeling to your thumb and first three fingers. It also helps you move your thumb.

Tendons also run from your lower arm, through the carpal tunnel, and into your hand. The tendons connect your finger bones to muscles in your arm, so you can bend your fingers.

If the tendons become swollen or irritated inside the carpal tunnel, they may press on the nerve. The squeezed nerve may not work well, which can lead to numbness, weakness, and other symptoms of carpal tunnel syndrome.
In certain cases, the cause of carpal tunnel syndrome is unknown. But it usually happens from a combination of things that affect the structures in your wrist, such as:

Injury to your wrist that causes swelling, such as a sprain or broken bone
Health conditions that can affect your nerves, joints, or other parts of your wrist, for example:
Diabetes.
Rheumatoid arthritis.
A cyst or tumor in your wrist.
Changes in certain hormones, which may cause swelling from extra fluid in your body. Examples include an underactive thyroid gland (hypothyroidism), pregnancy and menopause.
Problems with the way your wrist is formed.
Doing the same wrist and hand movements over and over, such as:
Assembly line work.
Carpentry or using tools that vibrate.
Knitting, gardening, or sports, such as golf.
Researchers aren't sure whether long-term typing or computer use leads to carpal tunnel syndrome.",68.6,8.7,7.3,10,6.5,8
AANS,Academic,W10,W10,"Carpal Tunnel Syndrome (CTS) is a common problem affecting hand function, caused by compression of the median nerve at the wrist. The carpal tunnel is formed by the multiple bones in the wrist and the transverse carpal ligament that forms the roof of the carpal tunnel. The median nerve and nine tendons run through the carpal tunnel. Carpal tunnel syndrome can result from inflammation and enlargement of the median nerve, inflammation and enlargement of the tendons, thickening of the transverse carpal ligament or by the presence of a mass lesion (for example, a tumor or cyst) within the carpal tunnel or a combination. Regardless of the direct cause, the end result is pressure on the median nerve and dysfunction.

Diseases or conditions that may increase the chances of developing CTS include broken or dislocation of wrist bones, pregnancy, diabetes, thyroid problems, menopause and/or obesity. Repetitive and forceful grasping with the hands or repetitive bending of the wrist may also contribute. Repetitive motions can cause significant swelling, thickening or irritation of the membranes around the tendons in the carpal tunnel, resulting in enlargement of the tendons and increased pressure on the median nerve. These repetitive movements include typing on a computer keyboard, talking on the phone (holding phone to the ear), texting or playing the piano. Professional artists (sculptors, printmakers, violinists) who engage in repetitive movements are frequently affected. Finally, jobs or hobbies requiring the use of vibratory tools (e.g., jack hammer) can place a person at risk of developing CTS symptoms.",40.5,15.7,12.4,13,11.4,13
ASSH,Academic,W11,W11,"Carpal tunnel syndrome is a condition affecting one of the main nerves in the wrist area. The carpal tunnel is a space created by the natural arch of the wrist bones. A thick band called the transverse carpal ligament creates a roof to the tunnel. This means that the size of the tunnel cannot change, as the bones and ligament act like solid walls. Nine tendons that bend the fingers and thumb and the median nerve pass through the tunnel. The median nerve provides feeling (sensation) to the skin of the thumb, index and middle fingers, as well as half the ring finger. The nerve also provides the communication line to the muscles at the base of the thumb (thenar muscles).

The most likely cause of carpal tunnel syndrome is extra pressure on the median nerve at the wrist inside the tunnel. This extra pressure can come from swelling (inflammation) of the contents inside the tunnel. When pressure results in nerve symptoms, it is called a compressive neuropathy. While the exact carpal tunnel syndrome causes are usually unknown and due to the patient’s personal anatomy, there are many factors that can contribute to the increased pressure or inflammation, including:

Rheumatoid arthritis.
Gout.
Amyloidosis.
Infections.
Psoriatic arthritis.
Arthritic spurs of the carpal bones.
Tumors.
Ganglion cysts.
Wrist fracture or dislocation of the wrist.
Repetitive motions performed at work or home.
Even making a tight closed fist or holding the wrist in bent or extended positions can put increased pressure on the median nerve. A prolonged or constant fist or bend (like a fist during sleep, reading a book, or some other activities) may put enough pressure to cause the numbness/tingling. If the funny feeling in the fingers just began, this is easily resolved by moving the fingers back and forth and out of the position. If the pressure continues off and on for weeks to months, the symptoms may come on faster after the activity or wrist position is created. It may also take longer for the symptoms to go away after the activity stops. Eventually, symptoms can become constant.

Repetitive activities in the workplace with forceful or repetitive gripping or vibration can also increase symptoms. However, it is complicated to determine if the work activity is the main cause of the symptoms or if work is incidentally just aggravating a condition that is already present (unrelated to work). The determination of cause of symptoms requires experienced and specialized health care providers to provide an opinion, taking many factors into account.

There are some risk factors that increase the chances of getting carpal tunnel syndrome. For example, women are more likely than men to experience carpal tunnel syndrome. It is more likely to occur with aging. Each decade someone is alive, there are more people that experience carpal tunnel syndrome. Thus, it is rare in children and adolescents and more common in ages 40 and over. Carpal tunnel syndrome is more common in people with obesity, diabetes, alcohol addiction, fibromyalgia and hypothyroidism. If you have carpal tunnel syndrome, your children may be more likely to get it. Also, during pregnancy, hormonal changes and extra body fluid retention may add swelling and pressure into the tunnel.

While symptoms can sometimes be worse at night, sleep has not been shown to cause carpal tunnel. Some people get symptoms while driving a car. This is also not necessarily the primary cause of the problem. The wrist position during driving or sleep, for example, may simply aggravate the symptoms.",57.5,10.6,8.8,11,7.9,9
Illinois Pain,Private,W12,W12,"Carpal tunnel syndrome is a very common condition that affects many people in the United States. Ergonomic disorders are some of the fastest-growing work-related illnesses.

 It is no surprise considering how much people work on their computers every day. The carpal tunnel is the passageway in the wrist through which various tendons and nerves pass through. When overused, this area can become inflamed causing the nerves to become compressed. Once the nerves are compressed, it can lead to numbness and pain in the first four fingers thus making day to day activities much more difficult. Below we list the top causes of carpal tunnel syndrome.

Overuse of the wrist is one of the top reasons people develop carpal tunnel syndrome. This is especially true in jobs that require a significant amount of typing on a computer.

 

The positioning of your wrist while you are working, long term exposure to vibrating tools such as power drills, or repetitive motion such as typing or playing the piano can all lead to carpal tunnel syndrome. These movements can all lead to the wrist being constantly overextended, which can cause the carpal tunnel to swell. Once the swelling occurs, nerve compression can happen which leads to the symptoms of carpal tunnel syndrome.

 

Trauma To The Wrist
 

Trauma to the wrist is another major cause of carpal tunnel syndrome. Trauma to the wrist can occur due to a car accident, a fall, or any other injury that causes the wrist to swell. Once this swelling occurs, the nerves in the wrist are compressed which leads to the painful and tingling feeling felt in the fingers.

 

Diabetes
           

Diabetes is a surprising cause of carpal tunnel syndrome. While diabetes does not involve trauma to or overuse of the wrist, left untreated, diabetes can damage nerves. If your blood sugar levels are left too high for too long, over time, the nerves in your extremities can be damaged. Your body’s natural reaction to damage is to swell in order for all the parts of the body to heal. As a result, the median nerve in the wrist may swell, leading to carpal tunnel syndrome as it becomes compressed.

 

Fluid Retention
           

Another common cause of carpal tunnel syndrome is fluid retention. There are a variety of causes of body fluid retention such as pregnancy, various medications, heart problems, and blood circulation to name a few. Regardless of the cause of body fluid retention, the end result is typically swelling. As with the reasons listed above, swelling in the carpal tunnel can lead the median nerve to become compressed, thus causing tingling and pain in the hand and wrist.

 

 

The best way to treat carpal tunnel syndrome is to make lifestyle changes to eliminate the suspected underlying cause. If these changes do not help the pain and tingling go away, there are other pain management techniques. These techniques include carpal tunnel injections and physical therapy for carpal tunnel syndrome. The injections can be used to help reduce swelling and physical therapy helps to gain back strength and range of motion in the wrist.

Health direct,Government,W13,W13,"Carpal tunnel syndrome happens when the median nerve comes under pressure in your wrist. The median nerve:

carries the sense of touch to the thumb and most of the next 2 fingers.
controls movement for some of the hand muscles.
The median nerve travels down your arm and through the carpal tunnel in your wrist. This is a narrow passageway with just enough room for your tendons and nerves to pass through. When your tendons swell or thicken, they take up more space in the carpal tunnel. This leaves less space for the median nerve, and it can become compressed.

Carpal tunnel syndrome can be caused by anything that makes the nerves or tendons larger. It can also be caused by things that make the carpal tunnel smaller. This includes:

a wrist or arm injury, such as a sprain or fracture.
activities that involve repetitive use (overuse) of the wrist and hand, including using vibrating tools.
rheumatoid arthritis and other joint disorders or connective tissue disorders.
tendonitis.
fluid retention during pregnancy or menopause.
a cyst or tumour in the carpal tunnel.
diabetes.
hypothyroidism.
abnormal growth of the hands (acromegaly).
kidney disease with dialysis.
Sometimes, carpal tunnel syndrome just happens without any obvious cause.

Some people are more at risk of developing carpal tunnel syndrome, such as:

females aged 40 to 60 years.
people aged over 70 years.
people with arthritis.
people who put on weight rapidly.
people who use their hands repeatedly in their work.
people who are pregnant.
Carpal tunnel syndrome is common in pregnancy. During pregnancy, the body holds more fluid, which can cause swelling. This can affect your carpal tunnel.",64.64,8.9,6.6,11,6.5,7

The median nerve controls some of the muscles that move the thumb and carries information back to the brain about sensations in your thumb and fingers.

When the nerve is squeezed it can cause tingling, numbness, pain or aching in the affected hand. Women are more likely than men to develop carpal tunnel syndrome. The condition affects people of all ages, but it’s more common in people over 50.

The median nerve is very sensitive to pressure, and it might not be possible to say what has caused the condition for you. Some of the things that can increase your risk of developing carpal tunnel syndrome are:

any form of arthritis in the wrist, especially if there’s swelling of the wrist joint or the tendons that run through the carpal tunnel.
hormonal changes, for instance during pregnancy, which can sometimes affect connective tissues and put pressure on the nerve.
the thyroid gland not producing enough hormones, sometimes called hypothyroidism or an underactive thyroid gland.

Better Health,Government,W15,W15,"Carpal tunnel syndrome is a painful disorder of the hand caused by pressure on nerves that run through the wrist. Symptoms include numbness, pins and needles, and pain (particularly at night). Anything that causes swelling inside the wrist can cause carpal tunnel syndrome, including repetitive hand movements, pregnancy and arthritis. Possible treatments include rest, splinting, cortisone injections and surgery.

In some cases the cause cannot be found. Sometimes there is a combination of factors such as:

Arthritis – various types of arthritis, especially rheumatoid arthritis, can cause inflammation and swelling.
Pregnancy – the hormones associated with pregnancy cause general fluid retention, which can compress the nerve. Carpal tunnel syndrome triggered by pregnancy usually goes away soon after birth.
Wrist fractures – bone fragments can irritate the tenosynovium or reduce the amount of space in the carpal tunnel.
Congenital factors – some people have a smaller carpal tunnel than others.

Medical News Today,Private,W17,W17,"Carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS) is a painful condition that occurs due to compression of the wrist’s median nerve. It can cause pain, numbness, and tingling in the hand and fingers.

Also known as median nerve entrapment or median nerve compression, CTS may happen when a nerve swells, the tendons become inflamed, or something causes swelling in the carpal tunnel.

Symptoms include tingling, burning, or itching and numbness in the palm of the hand and the fingers, especially the thumb and the index finger.

The National Institute of Neurological Disorders and StrokeTrusted Source describes CTS as the “the most common and widely known of the entrapment neuropathies, in which one of the body’s peripheral nerves is pressed on or squeezed.”

In the United States, CTS affects 1–3 people per 1,000 every year. Most people receive a CTS diagnosis between the ages of 40 and 60 years, and the prevalence increases with age. The condition can appear in one or both wrists. It is also more common in females than in males.

Without treatment, CTS can have a negative impact on a person’s quality of life. Eventually, the median nerve can become severely damaged. Consequently, there may be permanent numbness in the fingers and permanent weakness in the muscles that are innervated by the median nerve.

CTS often results from repetitive wrist movements, and therefore, it is commonly linked to computer use. However, reports date back to the 1800s, and the condition was familiar to orthopedic surgeons before the widespread use of computers.

The carpal tunnel, also known as the carpal canal, is a narrow, rigid passageway of bones and ligaments at the base of the hand. The median nerve and tendons are also in the carpal tunnel.

The carpal tunnel can sometimes narrow because the tendons become irritated and inflamed or because some other swelling puts pressure on the median nerve.

Sensations to the palm, the thumb, and three other fingers are controlled by the median nerve. The median nerve also controls the muscle that brings the thumb across the palm to touch the little finger. It does not, however, control the little finger.

Pressure on this nerve can lead to pain, numbness, and weakness in the hand and wrist, and this may cause pain to radiate up the arm and even to the shoulder.

CTS can develop for various reasons. However, it is more likely if a person frequently uses extremes of wrist motion, if they are exposed to vibration, and if they repeatedly use their fingers — for example, when typing.

Sometimes, however, there is no clear cause.

Some of the more common causes of CTS include:

repetitive maneuvers.
repeated use of vibrating hand tools.
pregnancy, for example, because of edema or fluid retention.
inflammatory, degenerative, and rheumatoid arthritis (RA).
hypothyroidism, or underactive thyroid.
diabetes.
physical trauma, such as dislocation or fracture of the wrist.
lesions in the wrist.
a cyst or tumor in the carpal tunnel.
an overactive pituitary gland.
any kind of swelling or inflammation around the tendons.
Occupational causes.
Certain occupations may put a person at a greater risk of developing CTS. According to the Canadian Centre for Occupational Health and Safety, the following occupations belong in that category:

farmers, specifically those milking cows.
workers using air-powered hand tools.
assembly-line workers handling objects on the conveyor belt.
check-out cashiers using laser scanners.
factory, farm, or mechanical workers who wear tight gloves.
gardeners weeding by hand.
locksmiths, turning keys.
mechanics, using screwdrivers and pushing down ratchets.
musicians using a bow for a stringed instrument.
office workers using mouse and keyboard.
painters who repeatedly use a spray gun.
poultry- or meat-processing workers who are deboning and cutting.
stablehands, painters, and carpenters who press tools into the palm.
Repetitive movements from activities such as knitting can also increase the risk of CTS.",54.7,11.1,8.7,12,8.5,9

Memorial Sloan Kettering,Academic,W19,W19,"Your carpal tunnel is a narrow tunnel in your wrist that protects your median nerve and other tissues (see Figure 1). Your median nerve is a nerve that runs from your forearm to your palm. It allows you to have feeling in your thumb and 3 middle fingers.

Carpal tunnel syndrome is when the tissues in your carpal tunnel swell and press on your median nerve. This can make your hand hurt or feel numb. In some people, the carpal tunnel is small, which makes them more likely to get carpal tunnel syndrome.

American College of Rheum,Academic,W20,W20,"Carpal tunnel syndrome is possibly the most common nerve disorder experienced today. The carpal tunnel is located at the wrist on the palm side of the hand just beneath the skin surface (palmar surface). Eight small wrist bones form three sides of the tunnel, giving rise to the name carpal tunnel. The remaining side of the tunnel, the palmar surface, is composed of soft tissues, consisting mainly of a ligament called the transverse carpal ligament. This ligament stretches over the top of the tunnel.

The median nerve and nine flexor tendons to the fingers pass through the carpal tunnel. Flexor tendons help flex or bend the fingers. When the median nerve in the wrist is squeezed (by swollen tissues, for example), it slows or blocks nerve impulses from travelling through the nerve. Because the median nerve provides muscle function and feeling in the hand, this causes symptoms ranging from mild occasional numbness to hand weakness, loss of feeling and loss of hand function.

Usually, carpal tunnel syndrome affects only one hand, but can affect both at the same time, causing symptoms in the thumb and the index, middle and ring fingers. In addition to numbness, patients with carpal tunnel syndrome may experience tingling, a pins and needle sensation or burning of the hand occasionally extending up to the forearm.

Frequently, symptoms appear in the morning after a person wakes up, but they can also happen during the night and interrupt their sleep. Symptoms can occur with certain activities such as driving, holding a book or other repetitive activity with the hands, especially activities that require a person to grasp something for long periods of time or bend their wrist. Activities that require use of the hands, such as buttoning a shirt, may become difficult, and carpal tunnel sufferers may drop things more easily. Individuals will often shake their hands trying to obtain relief and may feel that their hand is swollen when no swelling is present.

Because numbness and tingling may be mild and occur only periodically, many do not seek medical help. However, the disease can progress to more persistent numbness and burning. In some severe and chronic cases of carpal tunnel syndrome, loss of muscle mass occurs at the base of the thumb on the palm side of the hand. In these instances, especially when untreated, individuals can experience hand weakness, impaired use of the hand, and loss of sensation in their hand due to permanent nerve and muscle damage.

Carpal tunnel syndrome may occur in patients who are pregnant, overweight or have various medical conditions, including thyroid disease, diabetes or arthritis, or injuries such as wrist fractures. It is still debated whether repetitive work activities cause carpal tunnel syndrome, but it is thought that some repetitive hand activities, especially motions that can produce vibrations, can worsen the symptoms. Just as frequently, the syndrome occurs on its own.

However, many other conditions also can be responsible for symptoms of pain, swelling, numbness or weakness in the hands, such as diseases of the nerves located anywhere from the neck to the wrist. The pain and swelling in the hand joints and wrists caused by arthritis also can be responsible. For example, pain at the base of the thumb is commonly caused by osteoarthritis. Tendonitis – an inflammation of the tendons that connect muscles to bones – can cause pain, swelling, and impaired use of the hand or wrist. Raynaud’s phenomena can cause numbness and burning of the fingers as a result of cold exposure and sometimes due to autoimmune diseases. Raynaud’s also causes fingers to have a whitish, bluish or reddish color at various times; color changes are not seen in carpal tunnel syndrome. Health care professionals should exclude these and other diseases before diagnosing carpal tunnel syndrome.",51.5,13.7,11.5,12,9.6,12
ChatGPT 1,Chat,Chat,C1,"Carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS) is a common condition that causes pain, numbness, and tingling in the hand and arm. It occurs when the median nerve, which runs from the forearm to the palm of the hand, becomes compressed or squeezed at the wrist.

Medical conditions: Conditions like rheumatoid arthritis, diabetes, hypothyroidism, and obesity can increase the risk of CTS by causing inflammation or fluid retention in the wrist area.

Hormonal changes: Hormonal fluctuations during pregnancy or menopause can cause fluid retention and swelling, which can contribute to the development of CTS.

Genetic predisposition: Some individuals may have a genetic predisposition to developing carpal tunnel syndrome.

It is important to note that in many cases, the exact cause of CTS remains unknown. A combination of factors likely contributes to the development of the condition in most individuals.",28.9,17.9,14.7,15,13.3,15
